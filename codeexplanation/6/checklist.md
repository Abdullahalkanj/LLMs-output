|  \[ ] | Data Model & Structure         | Definition of the `Node` inner class, sentinel `header`/`trailer`, and `size` field in `DoublyLinkedBase`.                             | Ensures understanding of the doubly linked list backbone and sentinel setup.                         |
|  \[ ] | Length & Emptiness             | Correct implementation of `__len__` (returning `size`) and `is_empty` (checking `size == 0`).                                          | Verifies that the deque exposes its length and empty status accurately.                              |
|  \[ ] | `insert_between` Logic         | Creation of a new node with correct `prev`/`next` links, updating neighbors, and incrementing `size`.                                  | Confirms correct insertion at an arbitrary position in the list.                                     |
|  \[ ] | `delete_node` Logic            | Unlinking the nodeâ€™s `prev`/`next`, decrementing `size`, nullifying node fields, and returning its element.                            | Checks that deletion cleans up links, updates size, and avoids memory leaks by clearing node fields. |
|  \[ ] | `first` & `last` Accessors     | Returning `header.next.element` or `trailer.prev.element`, with `Empty` exception if deque is empty.                                   | Ensures front/back retrieval works and underflow is handled.                                         |
|  \[ ] | `insert_first` & `insert_last` | Correctly delegating to `insert_between` with `header`/`trailer` sentinels to add elements at both ends.                               | Verifies easy-to-use API for adding to front or back.                                                |
|  \[ ] | `delete_first` & `delete_last` | Correctly checking emptiness, then delegating to `delete_node` on the first/last real node.                                            | Ensures removal from both ends with proper underflow checks.                                         |
|  \[ ] | Underflow Exception            | Raising `Empty("Deque is empty")` in `first`, `last`, `delete_first`, `delete_last` when the deque is empty.                           | Confirms consistent error signaling for illegal operations.                                          |
|  \[ ] | Demo & Usage                   | The `__main__` block enqueues \[1,2,3] via `insert_last`, then exercises `first`, `last`, `delete_first`, `delete_last`, and `len(D)`. | Validates that the example demonstrates the intended behavior and state changes.                     |
