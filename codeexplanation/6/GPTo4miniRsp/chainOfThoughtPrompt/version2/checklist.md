|   ✔️  | Data Model & Structure         | `Node` inner class, sentinel `header`/`trailer`, and `size` in `DoublyLinkedBase`.                                                           | Ensures understanding of the doubly linked list backbone and sentinel setup.           |
|   ✔️  | Length & Emptiness             | `__len__` returns `self.size` and `is_empty` checks `self.size == 0`.                                                                        | Verifies that the deque accurately reports its length and empty status.                |
|   ✔️  | `insert_between` Logic         | Creation of a new node between given predecessor and successor, updating both pointers, and incrementing `size`.                             | Confirms correct insertion mechanics and size maintenance.                             |
|   ✔️  | `delete_node` Logic            | Unlinking a node by bypassing it, decrementing `size`, nullifying its `prev`/`next`/`element`, and returning the element.                    | Checks safe removal, size update, and cleanup to avoid dangling references.            |
|   ✔️  | `first` & `last` Accessors     | Returning `header.next.element` or `trailer.prev.element`, raising `Empty` if deque is empty.                                                | Ensures front/back peek operations work and underflow is handled via exception.        |
|   ✔️  | `insert_first` & `insert_last` | Delegation to `insert_between` with correct sentinel and neighbor arguments to add elements at front or back.                                | Verifies the high‐level deque API correctly adds elements at both ends.                |
|   ✔️  | `delete_first` & `delete_last` | Checking emptiness then delegating to `delete_node` on the front/back node.                                                                  | Ensures proper removal from both ends with correct underflow checks.                   |
|   ✔️  | Underflow Exception            | Raising `Empty("Deque is empty")` in `first`, `last`, `delete_first`, and `delete_last` when deque is empty.                                 | Confirms consistent error signaling for illegal operations on an empty deque.          |
|   ✔️  | Sentinel Benefits              | Use of `header` and `trailer` sentinels to avoid `None` checks when inserting or deleting at boundaries.                                     | Highlights why sentinels simplify edge‐case logic and make code more robust.           |
|   ✔️  | Demo & Usage                   | `__main__` block: inserts `[1, 2, 3]` via `insert_last`, then exercises `first`, `last`, `delete_first`, `delete_last`, and prints `len(D)`. | Validates that the example demonstrates expected deque behavior and state transitions. |
