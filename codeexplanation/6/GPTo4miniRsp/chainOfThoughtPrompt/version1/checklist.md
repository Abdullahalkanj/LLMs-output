|   ✔️  | Data Model & Structure         | `Node` inner class, sentinel `header`/`trailer`, and `size` in `DoublyLinkedBase`.                                       | Ensures understanding of the underlying doubly linked list with sentinels and size tracking.      |
|   ✔️  | Length & Emptiness             | `__len__` returns `self.size` and `is_empty` checks `self.size == 0`.                                                    | Verifies correct reporting of deque length and empty state.                                       |
|   ✔️  | `insert_between` Logic         | Creation of a new node between two given nodes, updating `prev`/`next` links, and incrementing `size`.                   | Confirms proper insertion mechanics and size maintenance.                                         |
|   ✔️  | `delete_node` Logic            | Unlinking a node by bypassing it, decrementing `size`, nullifying its pointers, and returning its element.               | Checks safe removal, size update, and cleanup to prevent memory leaks.                            |
|   ✔️  | `first` & `last` Accessors     | Returning `header.next.element` or `trailer.prev.element` with an `Empty` exception if deque is empty.                   | Ensures peek operations work correctly and underflow is handled.                                  |
|   ✔️  | `insert_first` & `insert_last` | Delegation to `insert_between` with appropriate sentinel/predecessor arguments to add elements at both ends.             | Verifies the deque API for front/back insertion is correctly implemented.                         |
|   ✔️  | `delete_first` & `delete_last` | Emptiness check then delegation to `delete_node` on the first/last real node.                                            | Ensures correct removal from both ends with proper underflow checks.                              |
|   ✔️  | Underflow Exception            | Raising `Empty("Deque is empty")` in `first`, `last`, `delete_first`, and `delete_last` when deque is empty.             | Confirms consistent error handling for operations on an empty deque.                              |
|   ✔️  | Sentinel Benefits              | Use of `header`/`trailer` sentinels to avoid `None` checks when inserting or deleting at boundaries.                     | Highlights how sentinels simplify boundary-case logic and make code more robust.                  |
|   ✔️  | Demo & Usage                   | `__main__` block: inserts `[1,2,3]`, then exercises `first`, `last`, `delete_first`, `delete_last`, and prints `len(D)`. | Validates that the example demonstrates and verifies the expected behavior and state transitions. |
