-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**1. Goal of the Code**
The code implements a **double-ended queue** (deque) using a **doubly linked list** as the underlying container. A deque supports insertion and deletion of elements at **both** ends in constant time. This implementation provides:

* Constant-time operations for adding/removing at front or back
* Methods to inspect the first and last elements without removal
* Proper handling of empty‐structure cases via a custom `Empty` exception

**2. Key Classes, Functions, and Logic**

| Component                    | Responsibility                                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `class Empty(Exception)`     | A custom exception raised when attempting to access or remove an element from an empty deque. |
| **`class DoublyLinkedBase`** | **Base class** that manages the core doubly linked list structure:                            |
| `class Node`                 | Nested node class holding:                                                                    |

* `element` (the stored value)
* `prev` pointer
* `next` pointer                                                            |
  \|  `__init__()`               | Creates two **sentinel** nodes (`header`, `trailer`) that mark the ends of the list, links them, and sets size to zero. |
  \|  `__len__()`                | Returns current node count (`self.size`).                                                             |
  \|  `is_empty()`               | Boolean test whether deque contains no real nodes.                                                     |
  \|  `insert_between(e, p, s)`  | Inserts new node with element `e` between nodes `p` (predecessor) and `s` (successor), updates links and size, and returns the new node. |
  \|  `delete_node(node)`        | Removes given `node` from the list by bypassing it in its neighbors’ pointers, decrements size, “scrubs” the node’s pointers for safe garbage collection, and returns the removed element. |
  \| **`class LinkedDeque`**      | **Subclass** of `DoublyLinkedBase` that provides deque-specific methods by calling the base insert/delete utilities: |
  \|  `first()`                  | Returns the first element (node right after `header`), or raises `Empty` if deque is empty.            |
  \|  `last()`                   | Returns the last element (node right before `trailer`), or raises `Empty` if empty.                     |
  \|  `insert_first(e)`          | Inserts element `e` at the front (between `header` and current first node).                             |
  \|  `insert_last(e)`           | Inserts element `e` at the back (between current last node and `trailer`).                              |
  \|  `delete_first()`           | Deletes and returns the front element (node right after `header`), or raises `Empty` if empty.         |
  \|  `delete_last()`            | Deletes and returns the back element (node right before `trailer`), or raises `Empty` if empty.         |

**3. Execution Flow (Start to End)**

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    D = LinkedDeque()               # 1. Create empty deque with two sentinels, size=0.
    for i in [1, 2, 3]:
        D.insert_last(i)            # 2. Insert 1, then 2, then 3 at the back.
    print("first ->", D.first())    # 3. Retrieve and print the front element: 1
    print("last ->", D.last())      # 4. Retrieve and print the back element: 3
    print("delete_first ->", D.delete_first())  
                                     # 5. Remove and print the front element: 1 (now deque has [2,3])
    print("delete_last ->", D.delete_last())
                                     # 6. Remove and print the back element: 3 (now deque has [2])
    print("size ->", len(D))         # 7. Print remaining size: 1
```

1. **Initialization**

   * `header` ⇄ `trailer`
   * `size = 0`

2. **Inserting 1, 2, 3 at the back**

   * After inserting 1: `header ⇄ [1] ⇄ trailer`, `size=1`
   * Then 2: `header ⇄ [1] ⇄ [2] ⇄ trailer`, `size=2`
   * Then 3: `header ⇄ [1] ⇄ [2] ⇄ [3] ⇄ trailer`, `size=3`

3. **Inspecting**

   * `first()` reads `header.next.element` → `1`
   * `last()` reads `trailer.prev.element` → `3`

4. **Deleting**

   * `delete_first()` removes the node after `header`, returns `1`, `size` decremented to 2
   * `delete_last()` removes the node before `trailer`, returns `3`, `size` decremented to 1

5. **Final size**

   * Only the element `[2]` remains, so `len(D) == 1`.

---

**4. Behavior Under Different Inputs**

* **Empty-Structure Operations**

  * Calling `first()`, `last()`, `delete_first()` or `delete_last()` on an empty deque raises `Empty("Deque is empty")`.

* **Inserting Other Data Types**

  * You can insert any Python object (e.g. strings, custom objects) as `e`. The deque is type‐agnostic.

* **Large Number of Operations**

  * As a linked structure, all insert/delete at ends remain **O(1)**, regardless of size.

* **Interleaved Operations**

  * The order of operations is maintained (FIFO if you only use back insert + front delete; LIFO if you use only one end for both insert/delete).
  * You can mix `insert_first`/`insert_last` and `delete_first`/`delete_last` arbitrarily—it will always correctly update links and size.

---

### Summary

This code provides a robust, efficient deque via a doubly linked list with:

* **Sentinel** nodes to simplify edge‐case logic
* Clear separation of low‐level list maintenance (`DoublyLinkedBase`) and high‐level deque API (`LinkedDeque`)
* Constant‐time end‐insertions/deletions and safe error handling for empty cases.
