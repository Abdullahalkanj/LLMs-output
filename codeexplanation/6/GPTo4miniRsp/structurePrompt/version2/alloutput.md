**Overview**
This Python program implements a doubly linked‐list–based deque (double-ended queue), allowing insertion and removal of elements at both ends in constant time. It defines a base class for the linked structure (`DoublyLinkedBase`) and then a subclass (`LinkedDeque`) that provides the public deque operations. At the bottom, there’s a small demo that exercises these operations and prints results.

---

**Main Components**

1. **`Empty` Exception**

   * A custom exception type raised when attempting to access or remove elements from an empty deque.

2. **`DoublyLinkedBase` Class**

   * **Nested `Node` Class**: Represents each element in the list, with pointers to its predecessor and successor.
   * **Constructor (`__init__`)**:

     * Creates two sentinel nodes, `header` and `trailer`, which do not hold data.
     * Links them to each other and initializes `size` to 0.
   * **Utility Methods**:

     * `__len__`: Returns the current number of real elements.
     * `is_empty`: Returns `True` if `size == 0`.
   * **Core Methods**:

     * `insert_between(e, predecessor, successor)`: Splices in a new node holding `e` between the two given nodes, updates pointers and size, and returns the new node.
     * `delete_node(node)`: Removes `node` from the list by bypassing it, decrements size, clears its fields to help garbage collection, and returns the removed element.

3. **`LinkedDeque` Subclass**
   Builds on the base class to expose deque operations:

   * **Accessors**:

     * `first()`: Returns element at the front; raises `Empty` if the deque is empty.
     * `last()`: Returns element at the back; raises `Empty` if empty.
   * **Mutators**:

     * `insert_first(e)`: Inserts `e` at the front by calling `insert_between` with `header` and its next node.
     * `insert_last(e)`: Inserts `e` at the end by calling `insert_between` with the node before `trailer` and `trailer`.
     * `delete_first()`: Removes and returns the front element; raises `Empty` if empty, delegates to `delete_node`.
     * `delete_last()`: Removes and returns the back element; raises `Empty` if empty, delegates to `delete_node`.

4. **Demo Block (`if __name__ == "__main__":`)**

   * Constructs an empty `LinkedDeque` named `D`.
   * Inserts the integers 1, 2, and 3 at the tail.
   * Prints results of `first()`, `last()`, `delete_first()`, `delete_last()`, and the final size.

**Key Logic Explained**

* **Sentinel Nodes**
  Having a header and trailer simplifies edge-case handling: you never have to check for `None` when inserting or deleting; you always have valid predecessor and successor nodes.

* **`insert_between`**

  1. Create a new node whose `prev` points to `predecessor`, and whose `next` points to `successor`.
  2. Adjust `predecessor.next` and `successor.prev` to link in the new node.
  3. Increment the `size`.
     This encapsulates all the pointer juggling needed for both front and back insertions.

* **`delete_node`**

  1. Identify the node’s neighbors: `predecessor = node.prev` and `successor = node.next`.
  2. Link `predecessor.next` to `successor` and `successor.prev` to `predecessor`, effectively removing `node` from the chain.
  3. Decrement `size`.
  4. Extract and return `node.element`, then clear the node’s own references to aid garbage collection.

* **Deque Operations**

  * Accessors simply look at the node adjacent to a sentinel (`header.next` or `trailer.prev`) and return its `.element`.
  * Mutators call the base methods, passing in the right sentinels or boundary nodes.

**What the Demo Prints**
Running the demo yields:

```
first -> 1            # The front element after inserting 1,2,3
last -> 3             # The back element
delete_first -> 1     # Removes and returns the front (1), leaving [2,3]
delete_last -> 3      # Removes and returns the back (3), leaving [2]
size -> 1             # One element remains (the 2)
```

So the code exercises insertion at the end, peeks at both ends, deletes at both ends, and reports the final size.
