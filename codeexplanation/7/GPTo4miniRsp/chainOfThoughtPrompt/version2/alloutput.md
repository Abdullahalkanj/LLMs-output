**Overall purpose**
This script defines two implementations of quick-sort—one that operates on a custom linked-queue and one that works in-place on a Python list—and demonstrates both on the same sample data.

---

## 1. What the code is trying to do

1. **Implement a queue** (`LinkedQueue`) backed by a singly linked list, with standard operations (`enqueue`, `dequeue`, `first`, `is_empty`, etc.).
2. **Implement `quick_sort_queue(S)`**, which:

   * Takes a `LinkedQueue` `S`.
   * Partitions its contents into three new queues `L` (less than pivot), `E` (equal to pivot) and `G` (greater than pivot).
   * Recursively sorts `L` and `G`.
   * Reassembles `S` by dequeuing from `L`, then `E`, then `G`.
3. **Implement `inplace_quick_sort(S, a, b)`**, which:

   * Takes a list `S` and index bounds `a…b`.
   * Chooses `S[b]` as pivot.
   * Partitions the segment in-place.
   * Recursively sorts the left and right partitions.
4. **Demonstrate both** on the list `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]`:

   * First by loading it into a `LinkedQueue`, sorting with `quick_sort_queue`, and printing the result.
   * Then by sorting the list in-place with `inplace_quick_sort` and printing that result.

## 2. Line-by-line walkthrough

```python
class Empty(Exception):
    pass
```

* Defines a custom exception `Empty` to signal operations on an empty queue.

```python
class LinkedQueue:
    class Node:
        def __init__(self, element, next):
            self.element = element
            self.next = next
```

* **Nested class `Node`** represents each element in the queue, holding the data (`element`) and a pointer to the next node.

```python
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None
        self.size = 0
```

* **Constructor** initializes an empty queue: no head or tail, size zero.

```python
    def __len__(self):
        return self.size
```

* Makes `len(Q)` return the number of elements.

```python
    def is_empty(self):
        return self.size == 0
```

* Checks emptiness.

```python
    def enqueue(self, e):
        newest = self.Node(e, None)
        if self.is_empty():
            self.head = newest
        else:
            self.tail.next = newest
        self.tail = newest
        self.size += 1
```

* **`enqueue(e)`**:

  * Wraps `e` in a new node.
  * If the queue was empty, both head and tail point to it.
  * Otherwise, links it after the old tail.
  * Updates the tail reference and increments size.

```python
    def dequeue(self):
        if self.is_empty():
            raise Empty('Queue is empty')
        answer = self.head.element
        self.head = self.head.next
        self.size -= 1
        if self.is_empty():
            self.tail = None
        return answer
```

* **`dequeue()`**:

  * If empty, raises `Empty`.
  * Otherwise, removes the head node, returns its element, decrements size.
  * If that was the last element, also clears `tail`.

```python
    def first(self):
        if self.is_empty():
            raise Empty('Queue is empty')
        return self.head.element
```

* **`first()`** returns (but does not remove) the front element.

---

```python
def quick_sort_queue(S):
    n = len(S)
    if n < 2:
        return
```

* If the queue has fewer than 2 elements, it’s already sorted—base case.

```python
    p = S.first()
    L, E, G = LinkedQueue(), LinkedQueue(), LinkedQueue()
```

* Chooses the first element as pivot `p`.
* Creates three empty queues:

  * `L` for “less than pivot,”
  * `E` for “equal to pivot,”
  * `G` for “greater than pivot.”

```python
    while not S.is_empty():
        if S.first() < p:
            L.enqueue(S.dequeue())
        elif p < S.first():
            G.enqueue(S.dequeue())
        else:
            E.enqueue(S.dequeue())
```

* Repeatedly look at `S.first()`:

  * If it’s less than `p`, dequeue it from `S` and enqueue into `L`.
  * If it’s greater, move it into `G`.
  * Otherwise (equal), move it into `E`.
* At the end of this loop, `S` is empty, and all elements are in one of `L`, `E`, `G`.

```python
    quick_sort_queue(L)
    quick_sort_queue(G)
```

* Recursively sort the “less” and “greater” sub-queues.

```python
    for Q in (L, E, G):
        while not Q.is_empty():
            S.enqueue(Q.dequeue())
```

* Finally, rebuild `S` by dequeuing every element from `L`, then `E`, then `G`, thereby concatenating them in sorted order.

---

```python
def inplace_quick_sort(S, a, b):
    if a >= b:
        return
```

* If the sub-array has one or zero elements, it’s already sorted—base case.

```python
    pivot = S[b]
    left, right = a, b - 1
```

* Takes the last element as pivot.
* Initializes two pointers, `left` at the start of the segment, `right` just before the pivot.

```python
    while left <= right:
        while left <= right and S[left] < pivot:
            left += 1
        while left <= right and pivot < S[right]:
            right -= 1
        if left <= right:
            S[left], S[right] = S[right], S[left]
            left, right = left + 1, right - 1
```

* Advances `left` forward while it points to elements < pivot.
* Moves `right` backward while it points to elements > pivot.
* If `left≤right`, swaps the out-of-place elements, and moves both pointers inward.

```python
    S[left], S[b] = S[b], S[left]
```

* Finally, swaps the pivot into position `left`; all to the left are ≤ pivot, all to the right are ≥ pivot.

```python
    inplace_quick_sort(S, a, left - 1)
    inplace_quick_sort(S, left + 1, b)
```

* Recursively sorts the “left” and “right” partitions.

---

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    Q = LinkedQueue()
    for i in [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]:
        Q.enqueue(i)
    quick_sort_queue(Q)
    print("Queue-sorted:", [Q.dequeue() for _ in range(len(Q))])
```

* Builds a queue of the digits of π (truncated).
* Applies `quick_sort_queue` to it in-place.
* Dequeues all elements into a Python list and prints:

  ```
  Queue-sorted: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9]
  ```

```python
    A = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]
    inplace_quick_sort(A, 0, len(A) - 1)
    print("List-sorted:", A)
```

* Copies the same data into a list `A`.
* Sorts it in place.
* Prints:

  ```
  List-sorted: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9]
  ```

---

## 3. Summary of the output

When you run the script as-is, you’ll see:

```
Queue-sorted: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9]
List-sorted: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9]
```

Both versions correctly sort the data in ascending order.

---

## 4. Behavior under different inputs

* **Empty input** (`[]` or an empty `LinkedQueue`):

  * Both algorithms hit their base case immediately and do nothing. They simply return; the printed result would be an empty list.
* **Already sorted input**:

  * Both quick-sorts still partition and recurse, but detect small subproblems quickly; performance degrades to O(n²) in the worst case (standard quick-sort behavior).
* **All elements equal**:

  * In the queue version, everything goes into the `E` queue in one pass; the recursive calls on `L` and `G` see empty queues and return immediately, so you just reassemble `E`.
  * In the in-place version, every partition step sees all elements “equal” to the pivot and ends up swapping nothing too harmful, though it still makes the recursive calls.
* **Different data types** (e.g. strings, custom objects):

  * Will work as long as the elements support the `<` comparison against the chosen pivot.
* **Large inputs**:

  * The queue-based version uses O(n) extra storage per level of recursion and costs time to re-enqueue elements.
  * The in-place version is more space-efficient (only call stack + a few pointers), but still risks worst-case O(n²) time unless you choose pivots more carefully.

In all cases, both functions preserve the stability of equal elements only insofar as the pivot‐equal group in the queue version is handled in FIFO order; the in-place version is not stable because of its swapping.
