The two methods together implement a generic, in-place Merge Sort on an array of any type that implements `Comparable`. Here’s the high-level flow:

1. **`mergeSort`**

   * Recursively splits the array into halves until subarrays are of length 1.
   * Calls **`merge`** on each pair of sorted halves to combine them.

2. **`merge`**

   * Merges two adjacent sorted runs (`[leftPos…leftEnd]` and `[rightPos…rightEnd]`) into a temporary array.
   * Copies the merged result back into the original array.

---

## Line-by-Line Explanation

```java
private static <AnyType extends Comparable<? super AnyType>>
void mergeSort( AnyType[] a, AnyType[] tmpArray, int left, int right ) {
```

* **Generic signature**: works for any `AnyType` that can compare to itself or a supertype.
* **Parameters**:

  * `a` the array to sort
  * `tmpArray` auxiliary array of the same length as `a`
  * `left, right` bounds (inclusive) of the subarray to sort

```java
    if( left < right ) {
```

* Base case: if the segment has more than one element, we need to sort.

```java
        int center = ( left + right ) / 2;
```

* Find midpoint (integer division)—left half is `[left…center]`, right half is `[center+1…right]`.

```java
        mergeSort( a, tmpArray, left, center );
        mergeSort( a, tmpArray, center + 1, right );
```

* Recursively sort left half, then right half.

```java
        merge( a, tmpArray, left, center + 1, right );
    }
}
```

* Once both halves are sorted, **merge** them into one sorted run spanning `[left…right]`.

---

```java
private static <AnyType extends Comparable<? super AnyType>>
void merge( AnyType[] a, AnyType[] tmpArray,
            int leftPos, int rightPos, int rightEnd ) {
```

* **Parameters** for merging:

  * `leftPos` start of the left run
  * `rightPos` start of the right run
  * `rightEnd` end of the right run
* The left run thus runs from `leftPos` to `rightPos - 1`.

```java
    int leftEnd   = rightPos - 1;
    int tmpPos    = leftPos;
    int numElements = rightEnd - leftPos + 1;
```

* `leftEnd` bounds the left run.
* `tmpPos` is the current write position in `tmpArray`.
* `numElements` is how many total elements we’ll merge.

```java
    while( leftPos <= leftEnd && rightPos <= rightEnd )
        if( a[leftPos].compareTo(a[rightPos]) <= 0 )
            tmpArray[tmpPos++] = a[leftPos++];
        else
            tmpArray[tmpPos++] = a[rightPos++];
```

* **Two-finger merge**: compare the heads of each run, copy the smaller into `tmpArray`, and advance that pointer.

```java
    while( leftPos <= leftEnd )
        tmpArray[tmpPos++] = a[leftPos++];
    while( rightPos <= rightEnd )
        tmpArray[tmpPos++] = a[rightPos++];
```

* Drain any leftovers from one run once the other is exhausted.

```java
    for( int i = 0; i < numElements; i++, rightEnd-- )
        a[rightEnd] = tmpArray[rightEnd];
}
```

* **Copy back**: starting from the rightmost merged element, copy each from `tmpArray` back into `a`.
* We decrement `rightEnd` each time so that after `numElements` iterations, all positions `[original leftPos … original rightEnd]` are updated.

---

## What the Code Produces

* **Sorted output**: after calling

  ```java
  mergeSort(array, new AnyType[array.length], 0, array.length - 1);
  ```

  the input array `array` will be in ascending order, according to its `compareTo`.

* **Stability**: elements that compare equal retain their original relative order (because on ties we take from the left run first).

* **Time complexity**: always *O(n log n)* for *n* elements (splitting in half, then linear-time merges).

* **Space complexity**: uses *O(n)* extra space for `tmpArray`.

## Behavior on Different Inputs

| Input Characteristic     | Behavior / Cost                                                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Already sorted**       | Still does full recursion and merging: *O(n log n)*.                     |
| **Reverse sorted**       | Same *O(n log n)* cost; merge comparisons all go to the right run first. |
| **All equal elements**   | Merges quickly but still does full work; stable so order preserved.      |
| **Small arrays** (`n≤1`) | Immediately returns—no work.                                             |

In every non-trivial case, you get a correctly sorted array in ascending order. If you change comparison direction (e.g. flip the `<=`), you’d get descending order instead.
