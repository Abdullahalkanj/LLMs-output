-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here’s a logical walkthrough of this Java implementation of merge sort, broken into your four steps:

---

## 1. Main Purpose

The two methods together implement **merge sort**, a classic divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.

* **`mergeSort(...)`** recursively splits the array into halves until single-element (sorted) subarrays remain.
* **`merge(...)`** then merges those sorted subarrays back together into a fully sorted array.

---

## 2. Variables & Data Structures

* **Type Parameters**

  * `<AnyType extends Comparable<? super AnyType>>`
    Ensures we can compare elements of the array via `compareTo`.

* **Arrays**

  * `AnyType[] a`
    The main array to be sorted.
  * `AnyType[] tmpArray`
    A scratch array used to hold merged results temporarily.

* **Indices**

  * In `mergeSort`:

    * `left`, `right`
      Bounds of the current subarray.
    * `center`
      Midpoint index used to split the subarray.

  * In `merge`:

    * `leftPos`
      Current index scanning the left subarray.
    * `rightPos`
      Current index scanning the right subarray.
    * `leftEnd = rightPos - 1`
      End index of the left subarray.
    * `rightEnd`
      End index of the right subarray.
    * `tmpPos = leftPos`
      Where to write the next smallest element into `tmpArray`.
    * `numElements = rightEnd - leftPos + 1`
      Total number of elements being merged.

---

## 3. Control Flow

1. **Recursive Splitting (`mergeSort`)**

   ```java
   if (left < right) {
     int center = (left + right) / 2;
     mergeSort(a, tmpArray, left, center);          // sort left half
     mergeSort(a, tmpArray, center+1, right);      // sort right half
     merge(a, tmpArray, left, center+1, right);    // merge them
   }
   ```

   * Base case: when `left >= right`, the subarray has ≤ 1 element and is already sorted.
   * Otherwise, split in two, sort each half, then merge.

2. **Merging (`merge`)**

   ```java
   // 1) Merge elements from both halves in sorted order
   while (leftPos <= leftEnd && rightPos <= rightEnd)
     if (a[leftPos].compareTo(a[rightPos]) <= 0)
       tmpArray[tmpPos++] = a[leftPos++];
     else
       tmpArray[tmpPos++] = a[rightPos++];

   // 2) Copy any leftovers from left half
   while (leftPos <= leftEnd)
     tmpArray[tmpPos++] = a[leftPos++];

   // 3) Copy any leftovers from right half
   while (rightPos <= rightEnd)
     tmpArray[tmpPos++] = a[rightPos++];

   // 4) Copy merged sequence back into the original array
   for (int i = 0; i < numElements; i++, rightEnd--)
     a[rightEnd] = tmpArray[rightEnd];
   ```

   * **Phase 1:** Compare heads of each subarray, copying the smaller into `tmpArray`.
   * **Phases 2–3:** One subarray may exhaust before the other—copy remaining elements directly.
   * **Phase 4:** Bulk-copy the merged block back into `a` in place.

---

## 4. Final Result & Why

After `mergeSort(a, tmpArray, 0, a.length-1)` returns:

* **`a` is fully sorted in ascending order.**

**Why it works:**

* **Divide:** Each call splits the problem roughly in half, reducing to trivial size (single elements).
* **Conquer:** Single-element arrays are “sorted” by definition.
* **Combine:** The `merge` method efficiently stitches two sorted lists into one, preserving order in linear time relative to their combined length.

Overall time complexity is **O(n log n)** (each level does O(n) merge work, across ≈ log n levels), and it’s stable (equal elements preserve relative order) and requires O(n) extra space for `tmpArray`.
