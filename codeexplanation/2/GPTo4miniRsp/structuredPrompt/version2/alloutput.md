Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of this generic Java implementation of heap sort:

---

**1. Short Overview**
This code sorts an array **in-place** using the heap-sort algorithm. It first “heapifies” the array into a max-heap, then repeatedly extracts the maximum element (at index 0) to the end of the array, shrinking the heap until everything is ordered.

---

**2. Main Components**

* **`leftChild(int i)`**
  Computes the index of the left child of node `i` in a binary heap stored in an array:

  ```java
  private static int leftChild(int i) {
      return 2 * i + 1;
  }
  ```

* **`percDown(AnyType[] a, int i, int n)`**
  Ensures the sub-heap rooted at index `i` (with total size `n`) satisfies the max-heap property by “percolating” the element at `i` down into its correct position.

* **`heapsort(AnyType[] a)`**
  Drives the whole sort:

  1. **Build phase**: transforms the array into a max-heap.
  2. **Sort phase**: repeatedly swaps the max (root) with the last element of the heap and re-heapifies the reduced array.

* **`swapReferences(AnyType[] a, int i, int j)`**
  (Assumed utility) swaps `a[i]` and `a[j]`.

---

**3. Key Logic in Each Section**

1. **`leftChild`**

   * Formula for a 0-based array representation of a binary tree:

     * Left child of node `i` is at `2*i + 1`.

2. **`percDown(a, i, n)`**

   ```java
   for (tmp = a[i]; leftChild(i) < n; i = child) {
       child = leftChild(i);
       // If right child exists and is larger, move to right child
       if (child != n - 1
           && a[child].compareTo(a[child + 1]) < 0)
           child++;
       // If tmp < a[child], move child up
       if (tmp.compareTo(a[child]) < 0)
           a[i] = a[child];
       else
           break;
   }
   a[i] = tmp;
   ```

   * **Initialization**: `tmp = a[i]` saves the value to percolate.
   * **Loop Condition**: `leftChild(i) < n` means “while there is at least a left child within the heap.”
   * **Choose Larger Child**:
     If there’s a right child (`child + 1 < n`) and it’s bigger than the left, use the right child.
   * **Percolate Down**:
     If `tmp < a[child]`, move the larger child up to position `i`. Then continue down from the child index.
   * **Insert**:
     Once the correct spot is found (no child is larger), assign `tmp` back to `a[i]`.

3. **`heapsort(a)`**

   ```java
   // 1) Build max-heap
   for (int i = a.length/2 - 1; i >= 0; i--)
       percDown(a, i, a.length);

   // 2) Extract-and-heapify
   for (int i = a.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
       swapReferences(a, 0, i);     // Move current max to end
       percDown(a, 0, i);           // Re-heapify the remaining heap
   }
   ```

   * **Build Phase** (`i = a.length/2 - 1` down to `0`):
     Every element from the last non-leaf node back to the root is percolated down, producing a valid max-heap.
   * **Sort Phase** (`i` from `a.length-1` down to `1`):

     * Swap the root (max) with the element at `i`.
     * Reduce the considered heap size by 1 (so the max stays at the end).
     * Call `percDown(a, 0, i)` to re-establish the heap among the remaining elements.

---

**4. What the Code Produces**

* **Effect**: It **sorts the input array `a` in ascending order**, in place.
* **Return/Print**:

  * There is **no return value** (`void` methods throughout).
  * It does **not** print anything by itself; you’d observe the sorted array by examining `a` after calling `heapsort(a)`.

---

**5. Summary of Flow**

1. **Compute child indices** via `leftChild`.
2. **`percDown`**: push down values to maintain heap structure.
3. **`heapsort`**:

   * Build a max-heap,
   * Swap max with end, shrink heap, and re-heapify,
   * Repeat until fully sorted.

After `heapsort(a)`, the original array `a` is rearranged so that `a[0] ≤ a[1] ≤ … ≤ a[a.length-1]`.
