-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Summary:**
This code implements a generic, in-place **heapsort** for arrays of any type that implements `Comparable`. It first builds a max-heap from the array, then repeatedly extracts the maximum element (at index 0) by swapping it to the end of the unsorted portion and “percolating down” the new root to restore heap order.

---

**2. Inputs & Outputs:**

* **Inputs:**

  * For `heapsort`: an array `a` of type `AnyType[]`, where `AnyType` implements `Comparable<? super AnyType>`.
  * Internally, `percDown` takes the array `a`, an index `i` to percolate down from, and an integer `n` indicating the “heap size” (elements in positions `[0 … n-1]`).
* **Outputs:**

  * The original array `a` is rearranged in **ascending** sorted order.
  * No new arrays are created; sorting is done in-place.

**3. Line-by-line explanation with comments:**

```java
// Compute the array index of the left child in a binary heap
private static int leftChild(int i) {
    // In a zero-based array, left child of node at index i is at 2*i + 1
    return 2 * i + 1;
}

// “Percolate down” element at index i in array a[0..n-1] to restore max-heap order
private static <AnyType extends Comparable<? super AnyType>>
void percDown(AnyType[] a, int i, int n) {
    int child;
    AnyType tmp;

    // Hold onto the element we’re moving down
    tmp = a[i];

    // As long as i has at least one child within the heap (i.e., leftChild(i) < n)
    for (; leftChild(i) < n; i = child) {
        // Index of left child
        child = leftChild(i);

        // If right child exists and is greater than left child, point to right child instead
        if (child != n - 1
            && a[child].compareTo(a[child + 1]) < 0) {
            child++;
        }

        // If the larger child is greater than tmp, move child up
        if (tmp.compareTo(a[child]) < 0) {
            a[i] = a[child];  // Promote child
        } else {
            // tmp is in correct spot
            break;
        }
    }

    // Place tmp in its final position
    a[i] = tmp;
}

// Main heapsort routine
public static <AnyType extends Comparable<? super AnyType>>
void heapsort(AnyType[] a) {
    // 1) Build the heap: call percDown for each non-leaf node, from bottom up
    for (int i = a.length / 2 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        percDown(a, i, a.length);
    }

    // 2) Repeatedly remove max element and rebuild heap on the reduced array
    for (int i = a.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        // Swap max (at 0) with element at i
        swapReferences(a, 0, i);
        // Restore heap order for a[0..i-1]
        percDown(a, 0, i);
    }
}
```

* **`leftChild(int i)`**

  * Calculates the left child index in a binary heap stored in a zero-based array.

* **`percDown(AnyType[] a, int i, int n)`**

  1. Saves `a[i]` in `tmp`.
  2. While `i` has at least one child within the current heap size `n`, let `child` be the larger of the two children.
  3. If that child’s value is larger than `tmp`, move the child up to index `i` and continue percolating down.
  4. When `tmp` is larger than both children (or no children remain), place `tmp` at index `i`.

* **`heapsort(AnyType[] a)`**

  1. **Heap construction:** Start at the deepest non-leaf node (`a.length/2 - 1`) moving backwards to the root, calling `percDown` to enforce the heap property.
  2. **Sortdown phase:** Swap the root (maximum) with the last element in the heap, reduce the heap size by one (excluding the sorted tail), and call `percDown` on the new root to re-heapify. Repeat until the heap is size 1.

This in-place heapsort runs in *O(n log n)* time and uses *O(1)* auxiliary space.
