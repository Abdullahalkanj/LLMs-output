-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This snippet is a classic implementation of **heap-sort** in Java, using a max-heap built in place on the array. Let’s step through each piece:

---

### 1. `leftChild(int i)`

```java
private static int leftChild(int i) {
    return 2 * i + 1;
}
```

* In a binary heap stored as an array, the node at index `i` has:

  * **left child** at `2*i + 1`
  * **right child** at `2*i + 2`
* This helper just computes the left-child index.

---

### 2. `percDown( AnyType[] a, int i, int n )`

```java
private static <AnyType extends Comparable<? super AnyType>>
void percDown(AnyType[] a, int i, int n) {
    int child;
    AnyType tmp;

    // Save the element to be “percolated” down:
    for (tmp = a[i]; leftChild(i) < n; i = child) {
        child = leftChild(i);

        // If there's a right child and it's larger than left, use it:
        if (child != n - 1
            && a[child].compareTo(a[child + 1]) < 0)
        {
            child++;
        }

        // If the child is larger than tmp, move it up:
        if (tmp.compareTo(a[child]) < 0) {
            a[i] = a[child];
        } else {
            break;    // tmp belongs here
        }
    }
    // Put tmp in its final position
    a[i] = tmp;
}
```

**What it does:**

* Takes the element at index `i` (saved in `tmp`) and “percolates” it down the heap until the heap-order property is restored.
* `n` is the “active” size of the heap (elements at indices `0..n-1`).
* At each step, it:

  1. Finds the larger of the two children.
  2. If that child is larger than `tmp`, it moves the child up.
  3. Advances `i` down to that child’s position.
  4. Stops when `tmp` is larger than both children or there are no more children.
* Finally, places `tmp` into the correct slot.

This ensures the sub-tree rooted at `i` is a valid max-heap.

### 3. `heapsort( AnyType[] a )`

```java
public static <AnyType extends Comparable<? super AnyType>>
void heapsort(AnyType[] a) {
    // 1) Build the max-heap
    for (int i = a.length / 2 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        percDown(a, i, a.length);
    }

    // 2) Repeatedly extract max and rebuild heap
    for (int i = a.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        swapReferences(a, 0, i);   // Move current max to the end
        percDown(a, 0, i);         // Restore heap on the remaining [0..i-1]
    }
}
```

**Stage 1: Heap Construction**

* We call `percDown` on all non-leaf nodes (from `a.length/2 - 1` down to `0`).
* After this loop, the entire array is arranged as a **max-heap** (largest element at `a[0]`).

**Stage 2: Sortdown**

* We repeatedly:

  1. **Swap** the root (`a[0]`, the max) with the last element in the heap (`a[i]`).
  2. **Reduce** the heap size by one (so that the largest element is “frozen” at the end).
  3. **`percDown`** the new root over the reduced heap to restore the max-heap property.
* This moves the next‐largest element to `a[0]`, which we then swap to position `i-1`, and so on.

When the loop finishes, the array is sorted in ascending order.

---

### Complexity and Characteristics

* **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) in all cases (build-heap is O(n), each of the n remove-max steps costs O(log n)).
* **Space Complexity:** O(1) extra (in-place sort).
* **Stability:** Not stable (equal elements may be reordered).
* **Generics:** Because of `<AnyType extends Comparable<? super AnyType>>`, you can sort any objects that know how to compare themselves.

---

**In summary:**
This code builds a max-heap in the array, then repeatedly removes the maximum element (swapping it to the end), shrinking the heap, and percolating down to restore the heap—thus producing an in-place ascending sort in O(n log n) time.
