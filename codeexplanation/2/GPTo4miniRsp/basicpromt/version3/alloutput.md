-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let’s walk through each piece of this Java implementation of **heap sort** on an array of elements that implement `Comparable`.

---

### 1. `leftChild(i)`

```java
private static int leftChild(int i) {
    return 2 * i + 1;
}
```

* In a binary heap stored in a zero-based array, the **left child** of the node at index `i` lives at index `2*i + 1`.
* This helper simply computes that index.

---

### 2. `percDown(a, i, n)`

```java
private static <AnyType extends Comparable<? super AnyType>>
void percDown(AnyType[] a, int i, int n) {
    int child;
    AnyType tmp;

    // Save the element we're going to “percolate” down
    tmp = a[i];

    // As long as there is at least one child in the heap (index < n)
    for(; leftChild(i) < n; i = child) {
        child = leftChild(i);

        // If there’s a right child, and it’s larger than the left child, use the right child
        if(child + 1 < n && a[child].compareTo(a[child + 1]) < 0) {
            child++;
        }

        // If the larger child is bigger than tmp, move the child up
        if(tmp.compareTo(a[child]) < 0) {
            a[i] = a[child];
        } else {
            // Heap property is restored
            break;
        }
    }

    // Put tmp into its final position
    a[i] = tmp;
}
```

**What it does:**

* **Percolates “down”** the element originally at `a[i]` so that the subtree rooted at `i` satisfies the **max-heap property** (parent ≥ children).
* It repeatedly swaps the “hole” at `i` with its larger child, moving the hole down until the element fits.

---

### 3. `heapsort(a)`

```java
public static <AnyType extends Comparable<? super AnyType>>
void heapsort(AnyType[] a) {
    // 1) Build the heap (max-heap) in-place
    for(int i = a.length / 2 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        percDown(a, i, a.length);
    }

    // 2) Repeatedly remove the max element from the heap and rebuild
    for(int i = a.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        swapReferences(a, 0, i);   // Move current max to the end
        percDown(a, 0, i);         // Restore heap on the reduced array [0..i-1]
    }
}
```

1. **Heap construction**

   * Starting from the last non-leaf node (`a.length/2 - 1`) and moving backwards, call `percDown` to ensure each subtree is a max-heap.
   * After this loop, the entire array represents a max-heap: `a[0]` is the largest element.

2. **Sort-down phase**

   * Repeatedly:

     * **Swap** the root (largest element) with the last element of the current heap (`swapReferences(a, 0, i)`).
     * **“Remove”** that largest element from the heap by considering the heap size to be one less (`i`).
     * **Restore** the max-heap property on the reduced heap by calling `percDown(a, 0, i)`.

   * After the loop finishes, the array is sorted in **ascending** order.

---

### Why it works

* A **binary heap** lets you get and remove the maximum in **O(log n)** time.
* Building the heap takes **O(n)** time when you “percolate down” from the middle backwards.
* Each of the **n−1** removals costs **O(log n)**, for an overall time of **O(n log n)**.
* This implementation sorts **in place** (only a constant amount of extra space) and is **not stable**.

---

### Key points

* **Generic** over `AnyType extends Comparable<? super AnyType>`, so you can sort any comparable objects.
* `percDown` maintains the **max-heap invariant**.
* `heapsort` first builds the heap, then repeatedly extracts the max into the tail of the array.
* Final result: the input array `a` is sorted in increasing order.
