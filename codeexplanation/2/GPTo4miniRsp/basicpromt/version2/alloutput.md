Sure— this is a classic array-based implementation of **heapsort**. Let’s break it down step by step.

---

### 1. `leftChild(i)`

```java
private static int leftChild(int i) {
    return 2 * i + 1;
}
```

* In a binary heap stored in an array, if a node is at index `i`, then:

  * its **left** child is at `2*i + 1`, and
  * its **right** child is at `2*i + 2`.
* This helper simply computes the left child’s index.

---

### 2. `percDown(a, i, n)`

```java
private static <AnyType extends Comparable<? super AnyType>>
void percDown(AnyType[] a, int i, int n) {
    int child;
    AnyType tmp;

    // Save the element at i
    for (tmp = a[i]; leftChild(i) < n; i = child) {
        child = leftChild(i);

        // If right child exists and is greater than left child, use right child
        if (child != n - 1 && a[child].compareTo(a[child + 1]) < 0)
            child++;

        // If the child is larger than tmp, move child up
        if (tmp.compareTo(a[child]) < 0)
            a[i] = a[child];
        else
            break;               // Heap property is restored

    }
    // Put tmp into its final spot
    a[i] = tmp;
}
```

* **Purpose:** “Sink” the element originally at index `i` **down** the heap of size `n` until the heap-order property (parent ≥ children) holds.
* **How it works:**

  1. **Save** the value at `a[i]` in `tmp`.
  2. As long as `i` has at least one child (`leftChild(i) < n`):

     * Let `child` = left child’s index.
     * If there’s also a right child (`child + 1 < n`) **and** it’s larger, bump `child` to the right child.
     * If `tmp < a[child]`, move the larger child up into the parent’s spot (`a[i] = a[child]`) and continue sinking `tmp` down to index `child`.
     * Otherwise, if `tmp` is already ≥ both children, we’ve restored the heap, so we stop.
  3. Finally, put `tmp` into its correct spot at `a[i]`.

---

### 3. `heapsort(a)`

```java
public static <AnyType extends Comparable<? super AnyType>>
void heapsort(AnyType[] a) {
    // 1) Build heap
    for (int i = a.length / 2 - 1; i >= 0; i--)
        percDown(a, i, a.length);

    // 2) Repeatedly remove max and rebuild heap
    for (int i = a.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        swapReferences(a, 0, i);    // Move current max to the end
        percDown(a, 0, i);          // Restore heap on the reduced array [0..i-1]
    }
}
```

1. **Heap construction (“heapify”):**

   * Every element from the last non-leaf node `(a.length/2 - 1)` down to `0` is “sunk” via `percDown`.
   * After this loop, the entire array `a[0..n-1]` satisfies the max-heap property (largest element at `a[0]`).

2. **Sortdown:**

   * For `i = n-1` down to `1`:

     1. **Swap** the max (at `a[0]`) with `a[i]`.
        Now the largest element is in its final spot at the end.
     2. **Restore** the heap property on the prefix `a[0..i-1]` by calling `percDown(a, 0, i)`.
        This ensures the next-largest element moves into `a[0]`.

After the second loop finishes, the array is sorted in **ascending** order.

### Visual Example

Suppose we start with

```
a = [4, 10, 3, 5, 1]
```

1. **Heapify phase** (`i = 1`, then `i = 0`):

   * `i = 1`: sink `10` — it’s already ≥ its children `[5,1]`, so nothing changes.
   * `i = 0`: sink `4`:

     * Children are `10` (idx 1) and `3` (idx 2); pick `10`.
     * Swap down: `[10, 4, 3, 5, 1]`.
     * Now sink `4` at index 1:

       * Its children are `5` (idx 3) and `1` (idx 4); pick `5`.
       * Swap down: `[10, 5, 3, 4, 1]`.
   * **Heap built**: `[10, 5, 3, 4, 1]`.

2. **Sortdown phase**:

   * `i = 4`: swap `10` and `1` → `[1,5,3,4,10]`; sink `1` in `[1,5,3,4]` → `[5,4,3,1,10]`.
   * `i = 3`: swap `5` and `1` → `[1,4,3,5,10]`; sink `1` in `[1,4,3]` → `[4,1,3,5,10]` → `[4,3,1,5,10]`.
   * `i = 2`: swap `4` and `1` → `[1,3,4,5,10]`; sink `1` in `[1,3]` → `[3,1,4,5,10]`.
   * `i = 1`: swap `3` and `1` → `[1,3,4,5,10]` (now trivially sorted).

Final sorted array:

```
[1, 3, 4, 5, 10]
```

#### Key Takeaways

* **Heapsort** runs in *O(n log n)* time, in place, using no extra array.
* `percDown` is the heart of both the **heap build** and the **sortdown** steps.
* The two main phases are:

  1. **Heapify** the entire array.
  2. **Repeatedly** swap out the max to the end and *sink* the new root.
