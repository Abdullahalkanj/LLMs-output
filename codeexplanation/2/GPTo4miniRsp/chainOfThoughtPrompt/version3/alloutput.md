Here’s a step-by-step walkthrough:

---
**Step 1: Main Purpose**
The code implements **heapsort**, an in‑place comparison-based sorting algorithm. Its goal is to reorder the array `a` into ascending order by first arranging it into a max‑heap and then repeatedly extracting the maximum element (at the root) to the end of the array.
---
**Step 2: Variables and Structures**
* **Array**
  * `AnyType[] a` – the generic array being sorted. Elements must implement `Comparable` so they can be compared.
* **Indices**
  * `i` – the current index being “percolated down” in the heap.
  * `n` – the effective size of the heap during percolation (shrinks as sorted elements accumulate at the end).
  * `child` – the index of the larger child of node `i`.
* **Value Holders**
  * `tmp` – holds the element at `a[i]` while we move children up to make room.
* **Helper Methods**
  * `leftChild(i)` returns the index of the left child of node `i` in a zero‑based heap: `2*i + 1`.
  * `swapReferences(a, 0, i)` swaps the root with the element at index `i`. (Implementation not shown but assumed to swap `a[0]` and `a[i]`.)
---
**Step 3: Control Flow**
1. **Heap Construction (Build Max‑Heap)**
   ```java
   for( int i = a.length/2 - 1; i >= 0; i-- )
       percDown(a, i, a.length);
   ```
   * Start from the last internal node (`a.length/2 - 1`) down to the root (`0`).
   * Call `percDown` to ensure each subtree satisfies the max‑heap property (parent ≥ children).
2. **Sorting Phase**
   ```java
   for( int i = a.length - 1; i > 0; i-- ) {
       swapReferences(a, 0, i);
       percDown(a, 0, i);
   }
   ```
   * Repeatedly swap the maximum element (`a[0]`) with `a[i]`, shrinking the heap size by one.
   * Call `percDown(a, 0, i)` to restore the heap property in the reduced heap.
3. **Percolate Down (`percDown`)**
   ```java
   for( tmp = a[i]; leftChild(i) < n; i = child ) {
       child = leftChild(i);
       // pick the larger of the two children
       if( child != n - 1 && a[child].compareTo(a[child+1]) < 0 )
           child++;
       // if child is larger than tmp, move child up
       if( tmp.compareTo(a[child]) < 0 )
           a[i] = a[child];
       else
           break;
   }
   a[i] = tmp;
   ```
   * Store the value at `i` in `tmp`.
   * While `i` has at least a left child within the heap (`leftChild(i) < n`):
     1. Identify `child` as the larger of the left and right children.
     2. If `tmp` is smaller than `a[child]`, move `a[child]` up to position `i`.
     3. Otherwise, the heap property holds and we stop.
     4. Update `i = child` to continue percolating `tmp` down.
   * Finally, place `tmp` into its correct spot.
---
**Step 4: Final Result and Why**
* **Result:** The array `a` ends up sorted in **ascending order**.
* **Why it Works:**
  1. **Max‑Heap Construction** ensures the largest element is at the root (`a[0]`).
  2. **Extraction Loop:**
     * Swap the root with the last element of the heap (`a[i]`), placing the largest remaining element at its final position.
     * Reduce the heap size by one and “percolate down” the new root to restore the max‑heap property.
  3. **Invariant:** After each iteration, the subarray `a[0…i-1]` is a valid max‑heap, and `a[i…end]` contains the sorted largest elements in ascending order.
  4. **Termination:** When `i` reaches 1, the remaining two‑element heap is fixed by one final percolation, and the array is fully sorted.
Heapsort runs in **O(n log n)** time in all cases, does not require additional array storage, and thus sorts the input efficiently in place.
