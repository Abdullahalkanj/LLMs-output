**Overview of What the Code Does**
This Java code implements an **in-place heapsort** on an array of elements that implement `Comparable`. In broad strokes, it:

1. **Builds a max-heap** in the array (so that the largest element is at index 0).
2. **Repeatedly extracts** the maximum element (at the root of the heap) by swapping it to the end of the unsorted portion, then “percolates down” the new root to restore the heap property.
3. Continues until the entire array is sorted in ascending order.

**Line-by-Line Walkthrough**

```java
private static int leftChild(int i) {
    return 2 * i + 1;
}
```

* **Purpose**: Given an index `i` in a **zero-based** array representation of a binary heap, return the index of its **left child**.
* For example, the left child of node at index 2 is at index `2*2 + 1 = 5`.

```java
private static <AnyType extends Comparable<? super AnyType>>
void percDown(AnyType[] a, int i, int n) {
    int child;
    AnyType tmp;
```

* **Generics**: Works on any array `a` of elements `AnyType` that are comparable to themselves or supertypes.
* **Parameters**:

  * `a` — the heap array.
  * `i` — the index of the subtree root to “percolate down.”
  * `n` — the **size** of the heap within `a` (elements from `0` to `n-1` are considered part of the heap).

```java
    for (tmp = a[i]; leftChild(i) < n; i = child) {
```

* **Initialization**: `tmp` holds the value at the start index `i`.
* **Loop condition**: As long as the node at `i` has **at least a left child** within the heap (`leftChild(i) < n`), continue.
* **Iteration update**: After moving down one level, set `i = child` to keep percolating further down.

```java
        child = leftChild(i);
```

* Compute the index of the left child of `i`.

```java
        if (child != n - 1
            && a[child].compareTo(a[child + 1]) < 0)
            child++;
```

* **If** there is also a right child (i.e. `child + 1 < n`), **and** the right child is larger than the left (`a[child] < a[child+1]`), then use the **right child** instead (`child++`).
* This picks the **larger** of the two children.

```java
        if (tmp.compareTo(a[child]) < 0)
            a[i] = a[child];
        else
            break;
```

* **If** the value we’re percolating down (`tmp`) is **smaller** than the larger child, move that child **up** one level (`a[i] = a[child]`) to fill the hole.
* **Else**, the heap property holds at this spot, so **stop** percolating.

```java
    }
    a[i] = tmp;
}
```

* Finally, place `tmp` into its correct position at index `i`, so that every node above it remains ≥ its children.

```java
public static <AnyType extends Comparable<? super AnyType>>
void heapsort(AnyType[] a) {
```

* Public entry point for heapsort on an array `a`.

```java
    for (int i = a.length / 2 - 1; i >= 0; i--)
        percDown(a, i, a.length);
```

* **Heap construction**: Starting from the last non-leaf node (`a.length/2 - 1`) down to the root (`0`), call `percDown` to ensure each subtree satisfies the max-heap property.
* After this loop, the entire array `a[0…a.length-1]` is a valid max-heap.

```java
    for (int i = a.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        swapReferences(a, 0, i);
        percDown(a, 0, i);
    }
}
```

* **Sorting phase**:

  1. **Swap** the root (maximum element) with the last element of the **unsorted** portion (`swapReferences(a,0,i)`).
  2. **Reduce** the heap size by one (now `i`), so the largest element is “locked” at the end.
  3. **Percolate down** the new root (`a[0]`) within the smaller heap (`percDown(a,0,i)`) to restore the max-heap.
* Repeat until only one element remains; at that point, the array is fully sorted in ascending order.

---

**Summary of Output and Behavior with Different Inputs**

* **Output**: The original array `a` is **mutated** in place and ends up sorted in **ascending** order.

* **Best-case / Already sorted**: Heapsort does the same work regardless of initial order—its time complexity is always **O(n log n)**. You won’t see early exits like in some other sorts.

* **Reverse-sorted**: It still runs in **O(n log n)**, building the heap and then extracting the max repeatedly.

* **Duplicate elements**: Stable relative ordering is **not** guaranteed; equal elements may be reordered.

* **Very small arrays**:

  * If `a.length ≤ 1`, the heapsort loops simply don’t execute and the array remains as is.
  * If `a.length == 2`, it builds a tiny heap, then swaps if needed, effectively performing a single comparison and swap.

* **Large arrays**: Performance scales as expected for heapsort—good space efficiency (in-place, O(1) extra space) and predictable runtime O(n log n), but with somewhat higher constant factors due to tree navigation.

In all cases, after calling `heapsort(a)`, you end up with `a[0] ≤ a[1] ≤ … ≤ a[a.length-1]`.
