**Overview**
This code defines a hierarchy of priority‐queue classes implemented with a binary heap, including an *adaptable* version that lets you update or remove arbitrary entries. At the bottom, there’s a short “demo” under `if __name__ == "__main__":` that shows how the adaptable queue behaves when you insert items, change a key, remove an entry by locator, and then repeatedly pop the minimum.

---

## Main Components

1. **`Empty` exception**
   A custom exception raised when an operation is attempted on an empty queue.

2. **`PriorityQueueBase`**

   * Inner class `Item` with `key`, `value`, and a `<` operator, so heap comparisons are by key.
   * Method `is_empty()` checks whether the queue has any entries.

3. **`HeapPriorityQueue`** (inherits from `PriorityQueueBase`)
   Implements a *min‐heap* with an array (`self.data`), providing:

   * **Index math**: `parent`, `left`, `right`; and tests `has_left`, `has_right`.
   * **`swap(i,j)`**: swap two entries (used in heap adjustments).
   * **`upheap(j)`**: move newly added entry at index `j` up to restore heap order.
   * **`downheap(j)`**: move entry at `j` down to restore heap order after removal.
   * **`add(key, value)`**: append a new `Item` and upheap it.
   * **`min()`**: peek at (but do not remove) the smallest entry.
   * **`remove_min()`**: swap the root with the last item, pop it off, then downheap the new root.
   * **`__len__`**: number of items.

4. **`AdaptableHeapPriorityQueue`** (inherits from `HeapPriorityQueue`)
   Enhances the basic heap so you can update or remove any entry given a *locator* handle:

   * Inner class `Locator` extends `Item` with an `index` slot to remember its position in the heap array.
   * Overrides `swap(i,j)` to keep each locator’s `index` field in sync.
   * **`bubble(j)`**: helper that chooses whether to `upheap` or `downheap` after a key change.
   * **`add(key, value)`**: returns a `Locator` token for later reference.
   * **`update(loc, newkey, newval)`**: change the key/value of the entry at `loc` and then `bubble` it.
   * **`remove(loc)`**: remove the entry at `loc` by swapping it to the end, popping it, then bubbling the swapped-in item.

5. **Demo block**
   Under `if __name__ == "__main__":`, it:

   1. Builds an `AdaptableHeapPriorityQueue`.
   2. Inserts four items with keys `[5,9,3,7]`, each returning a locator.
   3. Prints the minimum.
   4. Updates the second-inserted item (originally key=9) to key=2, then prints the new minimum.
   5. Removes the third-inserted item (originally key=3) via its locator.
   6. Pops and prints all remaining items in key order until the queue is empty.

## Key Logic in Each Section

| Section                  | What’s happening                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`upheap`**             | While a node’s key is smaller than its parent’s, swap it upward until the heap order is restored.        |
| **`downheap`**           | Compare the node with its smallest child; if that child is smaller, swap down and recurse.               |
| **`add`**                | Append a new `Item`/`Locator` to the array, then call `upheap` on its index to position it correctly.    |
| **`min` / `remove_min`** | `min` peeks at `data[0]`; `remove_min` swaps root with last, pops it, then `downheap` the new root.      |
| **`Locator` & `swap`**   | On every swap, update each locator’s `.index` so you can later find and adjust its position in the heap. |
| **`update`**             | Change an entry’s key/value in place, then call `bubble` to restore heap order by moving it up or down.  |
| **`remove(loc)`**        | Swap the target locator with the last entry, pop it off, then `bubble` the item now at that position.    |

## What the Demo Prints

Running the demo yields these lines:

```
min: (3, 'val3')
min after update: (2, 'val2')
removed: (3, 'val3')
remove_min: (2, 'val2')
remove_min: (5, 'val5')
remove_min: (7, 'val7')
```

1. **`min:`** the smallest among {5,9,3,7} is key 3.
2. After updating the entry with original key 9 to key 2, **`min after update:`** is now (2, 'val2').
3. **`removed:`** shows that removing the locator for the original key 3 yields (3, 'val3').
4. The loop then **`remove_min:`** in ascending order of remaining keys: 2, 5, 7.

**Summary**

* The code builds a binary‐heap–backed priority queue with full adaptability (you can update or remove any entry by locator).
* Heap‐maintenance is done via recursive `upheap` and `downheap`.
* Locators track their own indices to support fast updates/removals.
* The demo illustrates inserting, peeking, updating a key, removing by locator, and finally extracting all minima in order.
