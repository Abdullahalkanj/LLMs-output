-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Overall Purpose (Code Intent)**
This code implements two related priority-queue abstractions backed by a binary heap:

1. **HeapPriorityQueue**: A classic min-oriented heap-based priority queue supporting insertion (`add`), peeking at the minimum (`min`), and removal of the minimum (`remove_min`).
2. **AdaptableHeapPriorityQueue**: Extends `HeapPriorityQueue` to let clients hold “locators” for entries, so they can later update the key or remove an arbitrary entry in O(log n) time.

---

## Class-by-Class Breakdown

### 1. `Empty(Exception)`

* A custom exception type used to signal operations on an empty queue.

---

### 2. `PriorityQueueBase`

* **Nested class `Item`**

  * Holds a `(key, value)` pair.
  * Implements `__lt__` to compare items by key.
* **Method `is_empty(self)`**

  * Returns `True` if the queue has no elements (delegates to `__len__`).

### 3. `HeapPriorityQueue`

A concrete min-heap implementation.

| Method                  | Purpose                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `__init__(self)`        | Initializes an empty list `self.data` to hold heap entries.                                                            |
| `parent(self, j)`       | Index of the parent of node at index `j`: `(j-1)//2`.                                                                  |
| `left(self, j)`         | Index of left child: `2*j + 1`.                                                                                        |
| `right(self, j)`        | Index of right child: `2*j + 2`.                                                                                       |
| `has_left(self, j)`     | `True` if left child index is in bounds.                                                                               |
| `has_right(self, j)`    | `True` if right child index is in bounds.                                                                              |
| `swap(self, i, j)`      | Swaps entries at indices `i` and `j`.                                                                                  |
| `upheap(self, j)`       | Recursively restores heap order by moving element at `j` up toward the root as long as it's smaller than its parent.   |
| `downheap(self, j)`     | Recursively restores heap order by moving element at `j` down toward the leaves, swapping with the smaller child.      |
| `__len__(self)`         | Returns number of elements in the heap.                                                                                |
| `add(self, key, value)` | Appends a new `Item(key, value)`, then calls `upheap` on the last index to restore heap property.                      |
| `min(self)`             | Returns the `(key, value)` at the root without removing it; raises `Empty` if heap is empty.                           |
| `remove_min(self)`      | Swaps root with last item, pops the last (old root), calls `downheap(0)`, and returns the removed `(key, value)` pair. |

> **Heap Invariants & Logic**
>
> * The heap is a *complete* binary tree in array form.
> * **Upheap**: If a newly inserted key is smaller than its parent, swap and recurse upward.
> * **Downheap**: After removing the min, the last element sits at the root; it “trickles down” by swapping with its smaller child until the heap order is restored.

> **Edge Cases**
>
> * Calling `min` or `remove_min` on an empty queue raises the custom `Empty` exception.
> * `upheap` stops at the root (`j==0`).
> * `downheap` only recurses if there is at least one child.

### 4. `AdaptableHeapPriorityQueue`

Adds “locator tokens” that clients can use to update or remove arbitrary elements.

#### Nested class `Locator`

* Inherits from `HeapPriorityQueue.Item` and adds an `index` slot to track its position in `self.data`.

#### Overridden & New Methods

| Method                              | Purpose                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `swap(self, i, j)`                  | Extends parent swap to also update each swapped item’s `index` field.                                                     |
| `bubble(self, j)`                   | After a key change at index `j`, decides whether to `upheap` (if it got smaller than its parent) or `downheap` otherwise. |
| `add(self, key, value)`             | Creates a `Locator`, appends it, does `upheap`, and returns the locator token.                                            |
| `update(self, loc, newkey, newval)` | Given a locator token:                                                                                                    |

1. Checks validity (correct index and identity).
2. Updates `loc.key` and `loc.value`.
3. Calls `bubble` to restore heap order around its position.
   \| `remove(self, loc)`                    | Given a locator token:
4. Validates it.
5. If at end of heap, just `pop()`.
6. Otherwise, swap it with the last element, pop it, then `bubble` at the swap position.
7. Returns the removed `(key, value)`.

> **Logic Behind Adaptation**
>
> * By carrying an explicit `index` in each token, the queue can locate and rebalance that entry in O(log n).
> * The `bubble` helper chooses between pushing the item up or down, depending on whether its key decreased or increased.

> **Edge Cases Handled**
>
> * **Invalid Locator**: Both `update` and `remove` verify that the provided `loc`
>
>   * Has a stored index `j` within bounds;
>   * Actually matches `self.data[j]`.
>     If not, they raise `ValueError('Invalid locator')`.
> * **Removing Last Element**: Special-cased for O(1) removal when the locator is already at the end.
> * **Updating Root or Leaves**: `bubble` gracefully handles both cases by choosing the correct direction.

## Example Usage (the `__main__` Block)

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    pq = AdaptableHeapPriorityQueue()
    locs = [pq.add(k, f"val{k}") for k in [5, 9, 3, 7]]      # Insert 4 items
    print("min:", pq.min())                                  # Peek min → (3, 'val3')
    pq.update(locs[1], 2, "val2")                            # Change key 9→2
    print("min after update:", pq.min())                     # Now min is (2,'val2')
    print("removed:", pq.remove(locs[2]))                    # Remove the original key-3 entry
    while not pq.is_empty():                                 # Drain remaining items in order
        print("remove_min:", pq.remove_min())
```

1. **Insert**: Keys `[5,9,3,7]`
2. **min()** → `(3, 'val3')`
3. **update(loc for 9 → 2)** → now that element becomes the new minimum.
4. **remove(locs\[2])** → explicitly remove the entry that was originally `key=3`.
5. **Drain** → repeatedly `remove_min()` to print the remaining in ascending key order.

---

### Key Takeaways

* **Heap-based PQ**: Efficient O(log n) insertions and removals of the minimum.
* **Adaptable Extension**: By storing back-pointers (locators) to heap positions, arbitrary updates/removals remain O(log n).
* **Robustness**: Checks for empty states and invalid locators, ensuring clients can’t corrupt the structure.
