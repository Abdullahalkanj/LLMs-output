-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This code defines a family of priority‐queue classes implemented with a binary heap (min-heap), and then extends it to support *adaptable* operations (i.e. changing or removing arbitrary entries after insertion). Here’s the breakdown:

1. **`Empty` exception**
   A simple custom exception used to signal operations on an empty queue.

2. **`PriorityQueueBase`**

   * Defines an inner `Item` class with a `key` and a `value`.
   * Implements `__lt__` so that items compare by key (the heap is ordered by smallest key).
   * Provides `is_empty()` by checking `len(self) == 0` (relies on subclasses defining `__len__`).

3. **`HeapPriorityQueue`** (inherits from `PriorityQueueBase`)

   * Maintains a Python list `self.data` as a binary heap, where for index `j`,

     * parent is at `(j−1)//2`,
     * left child at `2j+1`, right child at `2j+2`.
   * **Core operations**:

     * `add(key, value)`: wrap into an `Item`, append to the end, then **up‐heap** (bubble it up until the heap property is restored).
     * `min()`: peek at `data[0]`, the smallest key.
     * `remove_min()`: swap the root with the last element, pop the last element (the old root), then **down‐heap** from the root to restore order.
   * `upheap` and `downheap` enforce the heap invariant in logarithmic time.
   * `swap` swaps two positions in the array.

4. **`AdaptableHeapPriorityQueue`** (subclass of `HeapPriorityQueue`)
   Extends the basic heap to let you *update* or *remove* any entry given a “locator” token returned at insertion time.

   * **Locator inner class**: inherits from `Item` and adds an `index` field to remember its position in the heap array.
   * Overrides `swap(i,j)` so that after swapping the entries, each locator’s `index` is corrected.
   * **`add(key, value)`** now returns the locator object so you can refer back to that entry later.
   * **`update(locator, newkey, newvalue)`**: you give it a locator, it updates the key/value in place, then calls `bubble(j)`, which decides whether to up‐heap or down‐heap from that index to reestablish the heap order.
   * **`remove(locator)`**: swap the target with the last element, pop it off, then bubble the swapped‐in element up or down as needed. Returns the removed key/value.

5. **Demo in `__main__`**

   * Builds an `AdaptableHeapPriorityQueue`, inserts keys `[5,9,3,7]` (storing locators).
   * Prints the minimum (should be key 3).
   * Updates the entry that had key 9 down to key 2, making it the new minimum.
   * Removes the entry that originally was key 3.
   * Finally, repeatedly `remove_min()` until empty, printing each.

In short, this is a textbook min-heap priority queue with an *adaptable* variant that allows efficient arbitrary updates and removals via locator handles.
