[Insert code here]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This code defines three related classes to implement a min-oriented priority queue using a binary heap, plus an “adaptable” version that lets you update or remove arbitrary entries.

---

### 1. `Empty` exception

```python
class Empty(Exception):
    pass
```

A custom exception raised when asking for an element from an empty priority queue.

---

### 2. `PriorityQueueBase`

```python
class PriorityQueueBase:
    class Item:
        __slots__ = '_key', '_value'
        …
```

* **Nested `Item`** holds a `(key, value)` pair and defines `__lt__` to compare by key.
* Method `is_empty()` returns `True` if the queue has no elements (i.e. its length is zero).

---

### 3. `HeapPriorityQueue`

Inherits from `PriorityQueueBase` and implements all the heap machinery.

#### Internal representation

* `self.data`: a Python list storing `Item`s in heap order.

#### Index helpers

* `parent(j)`, `left(j)`, `right(j)`: compute the index of a node’s parent or children.
* `has_left(j)`, `has_right(j)`: check if those child indices are in range.

#### Core operations

* **`swap(i, j)`**
  Swaps `data[i]` and `data[j]`.

* **`upheap(j)`** (a.k.a. “bubble up”)
  If the item at index `j` is smaller than its parent, swap and recurse upward.

* **`downheap(j)`** (a.k.a. “bubble down”)
  Compare the item at `j` to its smaller child; if the child is smaller, swap and recurse downward.

#### Public methods

* **`__len__`**
  Returns the number of elements, so `is_empty()` works.

* **`add(key, value)`**
  Wraps the pair in an `Item`, appends it to the end of the list, then calls `upheap` to restore heap order.

* **`min()`**
  Returns the `(key, value)` at the root (index 0) without removing it. Raises `Empty` if empty.

* **`remove_min()`**
  Swaps the root with the last element, pops off the smallest item, then calls `downheap(0)`. Returns the popped `(key, value)`. Raises `Empty` if empty.

---

### 4. `AdaptableHeapPriorityQueue`

Extends `HeapPriorityQueue` so you can:

* **Add** an item and get back a *locator* (a handle you can keep).
* **Update** or **remove** any entry by passing in its locator.

#### Locator objects

```python
class Locator(HeapPriorityQueue.Item):
    __slots__ = '_index'
    …
    def __init__(self, k, v, j):
        super().__init__(k, v)
        self.index = j
```

* Inherits from `Item` (so has `key`, `value`, and comparison by key).
* Adds an `index` field tracking its current position in `data`.

#### Overridden methods

* **`swap(i, j)`**
  After swapping two entries in `data`, updates their `.index` attributes.

* **`bubble(j)`**
  Chooses to `upheap` or `downheap` based on whether the item got smaller or larger.

* **`add(key, value)`**
  Creates a `Locator`, stores it, and returns it instead of returning nothing.

* **`update(loc, newkey, newval)`**
  Given a locator, checks it’s valid, updates its key/value, then calls `bubble` to restore heap order.

* **`remove(loc)`**
  Removes the element at `loc.index` by swapping it with the last item, popping it off, then bubbling the swapped-in item into place. Returns the removed `(key, value)`.

---

### 5. Usage example (`__main__`)

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    pq = AdaptableHeapPriorityQueue()
    locs = [pq.add(k, f"val{k}") for k in [5, 9, 3, 7]]
    print("min:", pq.min())                  # Should print the smallest key (3)
    pq.update(locs[1], 2, "val2")            # Change key=9→2 for the second locator
    print("min after update:", pq.min())     # Now 2 is the smallest
    print("removed:", pq.remove(locs[2]))    # Remove the locator originally at key=3
    while not pq.is_empty():
        print("remove_min:", pq.remove_min())
```

1. **Insert** keys 5, 9, 3, 7.
2. **Peek** at min → `(3, "val3")`.
3. **Update** the item that was key 9 down to key 2 → becomes new minimum.
4. **Remove** the original key 3 entry (wherever it sits).
5. **Drain** the queue via successive `remove_min()` calls, printing each.

---

#### In summary

* **`HeapPriorityQueue`** is a standard min-heap–based priority queue with `add`, `min`, and `remove_min`.
* **`AdaptableHeapPriorityQueue`** adds the ability to keep and use locators for arbitrary updates and removals, while still maintaining all operations in *O*(log n) time.
