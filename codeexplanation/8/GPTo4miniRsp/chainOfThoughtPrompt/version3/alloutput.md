-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Step 1: Main Purpose**
This code implements a **min-heap priority queue** data structure, with two variants:

1. **HeapPriorityQueue** – a basic array-based min-heap supporting `add`, `min`, and `remove_min`.
2. **AdaptableHeapPriorityQueue** – extends the base heap to allow clients to **locate**, **update**, and **remove** arbitrary entries in logarithmic time, via a “locator” object that tracks each entry’s current index in the heap.

---

**Step 2: Variables and Structures**

* **Classes & Exceptions**

  * `Empty`: exception raised when performing operations on an empty queue.
  * `PriorityQueueBase`: abstract base with nested `Item` class (holds key/value and defines `<` for comparisons).

* **HeapPriorityQueue**

  * **Attributes**

    * `self.data`: a Python list storing `Item` instances to represent a binary heap.
  * **Helper methods**

    * `parent(j)`, `left(j)`, `right(j)`, `has_left(j)`, `has_right(j)`: index calculations for tree navigation.
    * `swap(i,j)`: swap two entries in `self.data`.
    * `upheap(j)` / `downheap(j)`: restore heap order by “bubbling” an out-of-place element up or down.
  * **Core API**

    * `add(key, value)`: append a new `Item` and upheap to maintain the min-heap property.
    * `min()`: peek at the smallest key (root of the heap).
    * `remove_min()`: swap root with last, pop it, then downheap the new root.

* **AdaptableHeapPriorityQueue**

  * **Nested `Locator` class**

    * Inherits from `Item` and adds an `index` slot to track its position in `self.data`.
  * **Overrides & Extensions**

    * `swap(i,j)`: after swapping array elements, update each element’s `.index` to reflect its new position.
    * `bubble(j)`: helper that chooses upheap or downheap depending on whether the key got smaller or larger.
    * `add(key, value) → Locator`: creates a `Locator`, appends it, upheaps, and returns the locator so the client can refer back to that entry.
    * `update(loc, newkey, newval)`: given a locator, change its key/value, then call `bubble` to restore heap order.
    * `remove(loc)`: remove an arbitrary entry given its locator by swapping it with the last entry, popping, then bubbling to fix heap order; returns the removed key/value.

---

**Step 3: Control Flow**

1. **Initialization**

   * `pq = AdaptableHeapPriorityQueue()` creates an empty adaptable heap.

2. **Building the Heap**

   * The list comprehension

     ```python
     locs = [pq.add(k, f"val{k}") for k in [5, 9, 3, 7]]
     ```

     inserts four entries with keys 5, 9, 3, 7.  Each call to `add` returns a locator that remembers where in the internal array its entry lives.

3. **Finding the Minimum**

   * `pq.min()` simply returns the `(key, value)` pair at `self.data[0]`.

4. **Updating an Entry**

   * `pq.update(locs[1], 2, "val2")` takes the locator for the original key 9 entry, changes its key to 2, then calls `bubble` on the element’s index.  Since 2 is smaller than its parent, `upheap` swaps it upward until the heap property is restored.

5. **Removing an Arbitrary Entry**

   * `pq.remove(locs[2])` removes the entry that was originally key 3.  Internally it’s swapped with the last element (to preserve a complete tree), popped off, and then `bubble` is used to re-heapify at that position.

6. **Draining the Queue**

   * The `while not pq.is_empty(): print(pq.remove_min())` loop repeatedly extracts and prints the smallest remaining entry until the queue is empty.

---

**Step 4: Final Result & Why**
When you run the `__main__` block, here’s exactly what gets printed and why:

1. **Initial min:**

   * After inserting 5, 9, 3, 7, the smallest key is **3**, so

     ```
     min: (3, 'val3')
     ```

2. **After update:**

   * We change the entry that was 9 → 2.  Since 2 < 3, the new min becomes **(2, 'val2')**, so

     ```
     min after update: (2, 'val2')
     ```

3. **Removed arbitrary entry:**

   * We then remove the original key 3 entry.  That prints

     ```
     removed: (3, 'val3')
     ```

4. **Draining via remove\_min:**

   * Remaining keys now are 2, 5, 7.  Repeated `remove_min()` yields them in ascending order:

     ```
     remove_min: (2, 'val2')
     remove_min: (5, 'val5')
     remove_min: (7, 'val7')
     ```

Putting it all together, the console output is:

```
min: (3, 'val3')
min after update: (2, 'val2')
removed: (3, 'val3')
remove_min: (2, 'val2')
remove_min: (5, 'val5')
remove_min: (7, 'val7')
```

This demonstrates the functionality of both **standard heap operations** and **adaptable operations** (update and remove) efficiently preserving the heap’s order.
