**1. Goal of the Code**
The code implements two flavors of a **priority queue** backed by a **binary heap**:

* **`HeapPriorityQueue`**: a classic min-heap where each element has a key (priority) and a value.
* **`AdaptableHeapPriorityQueue`**: extends the heap so that once you’ve inserted an item, you keep a **locator** (token) that lets you later:

  * **update** its key or value,
  * **remove** it directly (not just the minimum).

This is useful in algorithms (e.g. Dijkstra’s shortest paths, A\* search) where you need to decrease-key or delete arbitrary entries efficiently.

**2. Key Classes, Functions, and Logic**

| Class / Method                   | Purpose                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `class Empty(Exception)`         | Custom exception when operations on an empty queue are invalid.                            |
| `PriorityQueueBase.Item`         | Simple container with `key`, `value`, and `<` defined so items compare by key.             |
| `HeapPriorityQueue`              | Implements a min-heap over a Python list (`self.data`).                                    |
|  • `parent`, `left`, `right`     | Compute array indices for heap structure.                                                  |
|  • `has_left`, `has_right`       | Bounds-check whether children exist.                                                       |
|  • `swap(i,j)`                   | Exchange two positions in the array.                                                       |
|  • `upheap(j)` (aka sift-up)     | Restore heap property by moving an out-of-place small key upward through its parents.      |
|  • `downheap(j)` (aka sift-down) | Restore heap property by moving an out-of-place large key downward through children.       |
|  • `add(key,value)`              | Append new `Item`, then `upheap` it into place.                                            |
|  • `min()`                       | Peek at the minimum key/value pair (root of the heap).                                     |
|  • `remove_min()`                | Swap root with last, pop it off, then `downheap` the new root to re-heapify.               |
| `AdaptableHeapPriorityQueue`     | Subclass that stores `Locator` objects (items that remember their index).                  |
|  • `Locator`                     | Extends `Item` with an `.index` slot so we can track where it lives in the array.          |
|  • `swap(i,j)` (override)        | After swapping, update each locator’s `.index` to reflect its new position.                |
|  • `bubble(j)`                   | Decides whether to `upheap` or `downheap` based on a changed key at position `j`.          |
|  • `add(key,value)`              | Returns the new `Locator`, so client code can hold onto it.                                |
|  • `update(loc,newkey,newval)`   | Given a valid locator, change its key/value, then `bubble` it to restore heap order.       |
|  • `remove(loc)`                 | Remove an arbitrary item by swapping it to the end, popping it, then `bubble` at its slot. |

**3. Execution Flow (Start to Finish)**

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # 1. Create an adaptable heap PQ
    pq = AdaptableHeapPriorityQueue()

    # 2. Insert four items with keys [5,9,3,7], values "val5" etc.
    locs = [pq.add(k, f"val{k}") for k in [5, 9, 3, 7]]
    #    - Internally: each add appends a Locator, then upheaps into the correct spot.

    # 3. Print current minimum (should be key=3)
    print("min:", pq.min())
    # --> min: (3, "val3")

    # 4. Decrease the key of the second‐inserted item (original key=9) down to 2
    pq.update(locs[1], 2, "val2")
    #    - update() sets locator.key=2, locator.value="val2", then bubble() moves it up to root.

    print("min after update:", pq.min())
    # --> min after update: (2, "val2")

    # 5. Remove the item that was inserted with key=3 (third in insertion order),
    #    which still lives somewhere in the heap
    print("removed:", pq.remove(locs[2]))
    # --> removed: (3, "val3")

    # 6. Finally, repeatedly remove the minimum until empty
    while not pq.is_empty():
        print("remove_min:", pq.remove_min())
    # Outputs the remaining entries in ascending key order:

    # remove_min: (5, "val5")
    # remove_min: (7, "val7")
    # remove_min: (9, "val2")  ← note: this was the one updated to key=2, but once removed and re-added
    #                           as 2, the original locator’s value still shows “val2”.
```

**4. Behavior Under Different Inputs**

* **Changing insertion order or keys**
  The heap always reorders itself so that `min()` and `remove_min()` give you the smallest key.  If you insert keys in sorted order vs. reverse order, the exact sequence of swaps differs, but the final behavior (sorted extraction) is the same.

* **Updating to a larger key**
  `update(loc, newkey, newval)` on a locator whose new key is **greater** than before will call `bubble()`, which detects no parent violation and so invokes `downheap()`, pushing the item down until the heap property holds.

* **Removing arbitrary locators**
  You can remove any existing locator.  If you remove the very last element, it’s a simple pop.  Otherwise, you swap the target with the last element, pop it, then `bubble()` the swapped-in element (at the target index), fixing either up or down as needed.

* **Invalid locator**
  Passing a `Locator` that is not current (e.g. one you already removed, or one from a different queue) causes a `ValueError('Invalid locator')`, as a safety check.

* **Empty-queue errors**
  Calling `min()` or `remove_min()` on an empty `HeapPriorityQueue` raises the custom `Empty` exception.

---

**Summary**
This code provides a robust priority-queue abstraction:

* **Standard heap** for simple min-priority operations.
* **Adaptable heap** for advanced scenarios where you need to tweak or delete entries in place.

Each operation (`add`, `min`, `remove_min`, `update`, `remove`) runs in **O(log n)** time (except peeking at `min()`, which is O(1)), making them suitable for performance-sensitive applications.
