| Check | Item                   | What to Check                                                                                                | Why                                                                                                                      |

|   ✔️  | Data Model & Structure | Definition and roles of the `Node` class (`key`, `left`, `right`) and `BST` class (`root`, methods).         | The response clearly explains `Node` fields and the `BST` constructor & `root` pointer.                                  |
|   ✔️  | Insertion Logic        | How `insert` delegates to `_insert_recursive`, the base case (`node is None`), and recursive placement.      | Section 3 walks through the base case, left/right recursion, and duplicate‐ignore behavior.                              |
|   ✔️  | Search Logic           | How `search` and `_search_recursive` locate a key via base case (`None` or match) and recursive descent.     | Section 4 describes returning `None` or the matching node, then recursing left/right.                                    |
|   ✔️  | Inorder Traversal      | Use of `_inorder_recursive` generator, `yield from`, and that `inorder()` returns a sorted list.             | Section 5 explains the in-order yield order and conversion to a sorted list.                                             |
|   ✔️  | Deletion Logic         | Handling of three cases in `_delete_recursive`: no child, one child, two children (using successor).         | Section 6 details leaf, one-child, and two-children cases with successor replacement.                                    |
|   ✔️  | Successor Finding      | How `_min_value_node` walks left pointers to find the in-order successor in the right subtree.               | The helper `_min_value_node` is shown and its left-tree traversal explained.                                             |
|   ❌  | Edge-Case Handling     | Behavior on empty tree, deleting/searching non-existent keys, and treatment of duplicate insertions.         | While duplicates and `None` returns are implicit, there’s no explicit discussion of empty trees or non-existent deletes. |
