This snippet implements a simple **binary search tree** (BST) in Python, complete with insertion, search, in-order traversal, and deletion (including all three deletion cases: leaf, one child, two children). At the bottom it builds a tree with a fixed sequence of keys, prints its in-order listing, then deletes three keys one by one—printing the in-order list after each deletion.

---

## 1. High-level overview

1. **`Node`**: a class representing a single node in the tree, holding a key and links to left/right children.
2. **`BST`**: a class encapsulating the tree, with methods to

   * **insert** a key (recursively),
   * **search** for a key,
   * **inorder**–traverse (to get a sorted list of keys),
   * **delete** a key (handling leaf, one-child, and two-children cases).
3. The `__main__` block demonstrates building a BST with keys `[50,30,20,40,70,60,80]`, printing it, then deleting `20`, `30`, and `50`, printing after each.

## 2. Line-by-line walkthrough

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.key = key
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
```

* Defines a **tree node**.
* Each node stores:

  * `key`: the value
  * `left` / `right`: initially `None`, will point to child nodes.

```python
class BST:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = None
```

* Defines the **BST container**.
* Starts empty: `root = None`.

```python
    def insert(self, key):
        self.root = self._insert_recursive(self.root, key)
```

* Public `insert`: kicks off a recursive helper on `self.root`, then re-assigns `root` (important when tree was empty).

```python
    def _insert_recursive(self, node, key):
        if node is None:
            return Node(key)
        if key < node.key:
            node.left = self._insert_recursive(node.left, key)
        elif key > node.key:
            node.right = self._insert_recursive(node.right, key)
        return node
```

* **Recursive insertion**:

  1. If current spot is empty (`node is None`), create a new `Node(key)`.
  2. If `key` is less than `node.key`, recurse left; if greater, recurse right; if equal, do nothing (no duplicates).
  3. Return `node` up the call chain, linking children appropriately.

```python
    def search(self, key):
        return self._search_recursive(self.root, key)

    def _search_recursive(self, node, key):
        if node is None or node.key == key:
            return node
        if key < node.key:
            return self._search_recursive(node.left, key)
        else:
            return self._search_recursive(node.right, key)
```

* **Recursive search**:

  * If `node` is `None`, key not found → returns `None`.
  * If `node.key == key`, found → returns that `Node`.
  * Otherwise recurse into left or right subtree depending on comparison.

```python
    def inorder(self):
        return list(self._inorder_recursive(self.root))

    def _inorder_recursive(self, node):
        if node:
            yield from self._inorder_recursive(node.left)
            yield node.key
            yield from self._inorder_recursive(node.right)
```

* **In-order traversal** (L-N-R) via a generator:

  * Recursively yields all keys in the left subtree, then the node’s key, then right subtree.
  * Wrapping in `list(…)` gives a Python list of sorted keys.

```python
    def delete(self, key):
        self.root = self._delete_recursive(self.root, key)
```

* Public `delete`: like `insert`, reassigns `root` in case the top node is removed/changed.

```python
    def _delete_recursive(self, node, key):
        if node is None:
            return None
        if key < node.key:
            node.left = self._delete_recursive(node.left, key)
        elif key > node.key:
            node.right = self._delete_recursive(node.right, key)
        else:
            # --- Found the node to delete ---
            if node.left is None:
                return node.right
            elif node.right is None:
                return node.left
            # Case: two children
            succ = self._min_value_node(node.right)
            node.key = succ.key
            node.right = self._delete_recursive(node.right, succ.key)
        return node
```

* **Deletion logic**:

  1. **Not found** (`node is None`): nothing to do.
  2. **Recurse**: go left/right if `key` is smaller/larger.
  3. **Found** (`key == node.key`): three cases:

     * **No left child**: replace node with its right child (which may be `None`).
     * **No right child**: replace node with its left child.
     * **Two children**:

       * Find **in-order successor** (`_min_value_node` in right subtree).
       * Copy its key into the current node.
       * Recursively delete the successor node from the right subtree.

```python
    def _min_value_node(self, node):
        current = node
        while current.left is not None:
            current = current.left
        return current
```

* Walks left until the smallest key in that subtree—the in-order successor when deleting.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    bst = BST()
    for key in [50, 30, 20, 40, 70, 60, 80]:
        bst.insert(key)
    print("Inorder before deletions:", bst.inorder())
    for key in (20, 30, 50):
        bst.delete(key)
        print("Inorder after deleting", key, ":", bst.inorder())
```

* **Driver code**:

  1. Builds a BST by inserting in this exact order:
     50
     ├─30
     │ ├─20
     │ └─40
     └─70
     ├─60
     └─80
  2. Prints the sorted keys (in-order):

     ```
     [20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
     ```
  3. Deletes `20` (a leaf), then `30` (now a node with one child), then `50` (the root, with two children), printing the in-order list each time.

---

## 3. Expected output

```
Inorder before deletions: [20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
Inorder after deleting 20 : [30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
Inorder after deleting 30 : [40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
Inorder after deleting 50 : [40, 60, 70, 80]
```

* **After deleting 20**: it was a leaf; it simply disappears.
* **After deleting 30**: 30 had only one child (40), so 40 takes its place.
* **After deleting 50**: the root had two children; we find its successor `60`, copy `60` into the root, then delete the old `60` node (a leaf). The new tree’s in-order is `[40, 60, 70, 80]`.

---

## 4. Behavior under other inputs

1. **Inserting duplicates**: this code ignores them (neither left nor right branch is taken on `key == node.key`, so no new node).
2. **Searching**: returns the `Node` if found (truthy), or `None` if not.
3. **Deleting non-existent keys**: nothing changes (the recursion bottoms out at `node is None`).
4. **Different insertion orders**:

   * A sorted insertion (`[10,20,30,40,…]`) yields a degenerate, linked-list–like tree (worst-case height).
   * A more random or balanced insertion order tends to keep the tree shallower, improving search/insert/delete times.
5. **Edge cases**: deleting from an empty tree does nothing; deleting the only node makes the tree empty again.

---

**In summary**, this code provides a working—but unbalanced—BST implementation. It correctly handles all basic operations and deletion cases. In practice, self-balancing variants (AVL, Red-Black) would be used to guarantee logarithmic depth in the worst case.
