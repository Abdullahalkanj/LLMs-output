|   ✔️  | Data Model & Structure | Definition and roles of the `Node` class (`key`, `left`, `right`) and `BST` class (`root`, methods).         | The high-level overview and line-by-line clearly explain these classes and their attributes.           |
|   ✔️  | Insertion Logic        | How `insert` delegates to `_insert_recursive`, the base case (`node is None`), and recursive placement.      | Section 2’s walkthrough covers base case, left/right recursion, and duplicate-ignore behavior.         |
|   ✔️  | Search Logic           | How `search` and `_search_recursive` locate a key via base case (`None` or match) and recursive descent.     | The search method and helper are described with their base and recursive steps.                        |
|   ✔️  | Inorder Traversal      | Use of `_inorder_recursive` generator, `yield from`, and that `inorder()` returns a sorted list.             | The generator logic and `list(...)` conversion are explicitly explained.                               |
|   ✔️  | Deletion Logic         | Handling of three cases in `_delete_recursive`: no child, one child, two children (using successor).         | The deletion process, including each case, is detailed in the line-by-line section.                    |
|   ✔️  | Successor Finding      | How `_min_value_node` walks left pointers to find the in-order successor in the right subtree.               | The helper’s loop and its purpose are clearly outlined.                                                |
|   ✔️  | Edge-Case Handling     | Behavior on empty tree, deleting/searching non-existent keys, and treatment of duplicate insertions.         | The “Behavior under other inputs” section covers empty tree, non-existent deletions, and duplicates.   |
