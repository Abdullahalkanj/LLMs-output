|   ✔️  | Data Model & Structure | Definition and roles of the `Node` class (`key`, `left`, `right`) and `BST` class (`root`, methods).         | The response clearly explains both classes and their attributes.                                                 |
|   ✔️  | Insertion Logic        | How `insert` delegates to `_insert_recursive`, the base case (`node is None`), and recursive placement.      | The breakdown covers base case, recursion left/right, and duplicate-ignore behavior.                             |
|   ✔️  | Search Logic           | How `search` and `_search_recursive` locate a key via base case (`None` or match) and recursive descent.     | The explanation describes both base cases and the recursive comparison steps.                                    |
|   ✔️  | Inorder Traversal      | Use of `_inorder_recursive` generator, `yield from`, and that `inorder()` returns a sorted list.             | The generator pattern and list conversion are explicitly detailed.                                               |
|   ✔️  | Deletion Logic         | Handling of three cases in `_delete_recursive`: no child, one child, two children (using successor).         | The three deletion scenarios are fully explained in the “Edge Cases Handled” section.                            |
|   ✔️  | Successor Finding      | How `_min_value_node` walks left pointers to find the in-order successor in the right subtree.               | The helper’s loop and purpose are clearly outlined.                                                              |
|   ✔️  | Edge-Case Handling     | Behavior on empty tree, deleting/searching non-existent keys, and treatment of duplicate insertions.         | A dedicated “Edge Cases Handled” section covers empty tree, duplicates, non-existent keys, and all delete cases. |
