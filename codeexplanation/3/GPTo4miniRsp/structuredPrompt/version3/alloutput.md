-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Code Intent**
This code implements a basic **binary search tree (BST)** in Python, complete with insertion, search, in-order traversal, and deletion operations. A BST maintains the invariant that for any node, all keys in its left subtree are smaller and all keys in its right subtree are larger. This allows for O(log n) average-time insert/search/delete when the tree is balanced.

## Class and Method Breakdown

### `class Node`

* **Purpose**: Represents a single node in the BST.
* **Attributes**:

  * `key`: the value stored at this node.
  * `left`: reference to the left child (initially `None`).
  * `right`: reference to the right child (initially `None`).

### `class BST`

* **Purpose**: Encapsulates the BST’s root and provides public methods to manipulate the tree.

#### `__init__(self)`

* Initializes an empty tree with `self.root = None`.

#### `insert(self, key)`

* Public API to insert a new key.
* Delegates to the recursive helper `_insert_recursive`.

#### `_insert_recursive(self, node, key)`

1. **Base case**:

   * If `node` is `None`, we’ve found the insertion spot → create and return a new `Node(key)`.
2. **Recursive descent**:

   * `if key < node.key`: insert into left subtree.
   * `elif key > node.key`: insert into right subtree.
   * **Duplicates**: if `key == node.key`, does nothing (no duplicate insertion).
3. **Link back**: returns the (possibly new) subtree root up the call stack.

#### `search(self, key)`

* Public API to find a node by key.
* Returns the `Node` if found, or `None` otherwise.
* Uses helper `_search_recursive`.

#### `_search_recursive(self, node, key)`

1. **Base cases**:

   * `node is None` → key not present → return `None`.
   * `node.key == key` → found → return `node`.
2. **Recursive descent**:

   * If `key < node.key`, search left; else search right.

#### `inorder(self)`

* Returns a Python list of all keys in in-order (ascending) order.
* Wraps the generator `_inorder_recursive` in `list()`.

#### `_inorder_recursive(self, node)`

* **Generator pattern** (`yield`):

  1. Traverse left subtree.
  2. `yield node.key`.
  3. Traverse right subtree.
* If `node` is `None`, does nothing (implicit base case).

#### `delete(self, key)`

* Public API to remove a node by key.
* Updates `self.root` via `_delete_recursive`.

#### `_delete_recursive(self, node, key)`

1. **Base case**:

   * If `node` is `None`, key not found → return `None`.
2. **Recursive descent**:

   * If `key < node.key`, delete from left subtree.
   * If `key > node.key`, delete from right subtree.
3. **Node to delete found** (`key == node.key`): three subcases:

   1. **No left child**: replace this node by its right child (which may be `None`).
   2. **No right child**: replace this node by its left child.
   3. **Two children**:

      * Find the in-order successor: smallest key in the right subtree (`_min_value_node`).
      * Copy successor’s key into current node.
      * Recursively delete the successor node from the right subtree.
4. **Return** the updated subtree root to reconnect up the stack.

#### `_min_value_node(self, node)`

* Starting at `node`, walks left until `current.left is None`.
* Returns the node with the minimum key in that subtree.

---

## Logic Behind Loops and Conditions

* **Insertion & Search**: simple binary decisions (`<`, `>`, `==`) guide recursion left or right.
* **In-order Traversal**: uses `yield from` to flatten left subtree, node, then right subtree.
* **Deletion**:

  * Conditions determine which subtree to recurse into.
  * Special handling when deleting the target node: the three-cases logic ensures tree structure stays valid.
* **`while` in `_min_value_node`**: finds the leftmost node.

---

## Edge Cases Handled

* **Empty tree**: inserting into or deleting from an empty tree works gracefully.
* **Duplicate insertion**: inserting an existing key does nothing.
* **Searching non-existent key**: returns `None`.
* **Deleting non-existent key**: tree remains unchanged.
* **Deleting leaf nodes** (no children): replaced by `None`.
* **Deleting nodes with one child**: replaced directly by that single child.
* **Deleting nodes with two children**: uses in-order successor strategy to avoid breaking BST properties.

## Example Run (driver code)

1. Build a BST by inserting `[50, 30, 20, 40, 70, 60, 80]`.
2. Print in-order: yields `[20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]`.
3. Delete keys `20`, then `30`, then `50`, printing in-order each time to show the tree updating correctly.

This demonstration confirms the correctness of insert, traversal, and delete operations under various scenarios.
