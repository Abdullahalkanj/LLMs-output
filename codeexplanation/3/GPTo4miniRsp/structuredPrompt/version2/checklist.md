|   ✔️  | Data Model & Structure | Definition and roles of the `Node` class (`key`, `left`, `right`) and `BST` class (`root`, methods).         | Ensures the explainer understands the building blocks and overall organization of the tree. |
|   ✔️  | Insertion Logic        | How `insert` delegates to `_insert_recursive`, the base case (`node is None`), and recursive placement.      | Verifies understanding of how new keys are placed to maintain BST ordering.                 |
|   ✔️  | Search Logic           | How `search` and `_search_recursive` locate a key via base case (`None` or match) and recursive descent.     | Confirms the explainer sees how lookups traverse left/right based on comparisons.           |
|   ✔️  | Inorder Traversal      | Use of `_inorder_recursive` generator, `yield from`, and that `inorder()` returns a sorted list.             | Checks recognition that inorder on a BST produces keys in ascending order.                  |
|   ✔️  | Deletion Logic         | Handling of three cases in `_delete_recursive`: no child, one child, two children (using successor).         | Ensures awareness of the classic BST delete cases and successor replacement.                |
|   ✔️  | Successor Finding      | How `_min_value_node` walks left pointers to find the in-order successor in the right subtree.               | Verifies the explainer understands how the replacement key is chosen for two-child deletes. |
|   ✔️  | Edge-Case Handling     | Behavior on empty tree, deleting/searching non-existent keys, and treatment of duplicate insertions.         | Confirms robustness and clarifies how duplicates and missing keys are handled.              |
