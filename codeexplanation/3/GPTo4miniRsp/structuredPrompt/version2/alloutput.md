**Overview**
This code implements a simple Binary Search Tree (BST) with the following capabilities:
* **Insertion** of new keys
* **Searching** for a key
* **In-order traversal** (to list all keys in sorted order)
* **Deletion** of a key, handling all three cases (leaf, one child, two children)
A small demo at the bottom builds a BST, prints its in-order traversal, then deletes a few keys one by one, showing the updated traversal each time.
---
### Main Components
1. **`Node` class**
   * Holds a single key and pointers to left/right children.
2. **`BST` class**
   * **`self.root`**: reference to the tree’s root node.
   * **Public methods**:
     * `insert(key)` → Insert a key into the tree.
     * `search(key)` → Return the node with that key (or `None`).
     * `inorder()` → Return a Python list of all keys in sorted order.
     * `delete(key)` → Remove a key from the tree.
   * **Private helpers** (prefixed with `_`):
     * `_insert_recursive(node, key)` → Recursively find the correct spot and attach a new `Node`.
     * `_search_recursive(node, key)` → Standard BST search recursion.
     * `_inorder_recursive(node)` → Generator yielding keys in left–node–right order.
     * `_delete_recursive(node, key)` → Recursively find and remove a node, re-wiring children as needed.
     * `_min_value_node(node)` → Find the smallest key in a given subtree (used when deleting a node with two children).
3. **Demo block**
   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       bst = BST()
       for key in [50, 30, 20, 40, 70, 60, 80]:
           bst.insert(key)
       print("Inorder before deletions:", bst.inorder())
       for key in (20, 30, 50):
           bst.delete(key)
           print("Inorder after deleting", key, ":", bst.inorder())
   ```
   * Builds a BST with seven keys.
   * Prints the sorted list of keys.
   * Deletes 20, then 30, then 50—printing the in-order list after each deletion.

### Key Logic by Section
#### 1. Insertion (`_insert_recursive`)
* **Base case**: if the current `node` is `None`, create and return a new `Node(key)`.
* **Recurse left** if `key < node.key`; **recurse right** if `key > node.key`.
* **Duplicates** are ignored (neither branch runs if `key == node.key`), so the tree holds unique keys.
#### 2. Search (`_search_recursive`)
* **Base cases**:
  * `node is None`: key not found → return `None`.
  * `node.key == key`: found → return this `node`.
* **Recurse** into left or right child depending on the comparison `key < node.key`.
#### 3. In-order Traversal (`_inorder_recursive`)
* If `node` exists:
  1. Yield all keys from the **left** subtree.
  2. Yield `node.key`.
  3. Yield all keys from the **right** subtree.
* The public `inorder()` method wraps this generator into a list.
#### 4. Deletion (`_delete_recursive`)
* **Locate** the node to delete by comparing `key` with `node.key` and recursing left/right.
* **Once found**, handle three cases:
  1. **No children** (`node.left is None and node.right is None`): return `None` to the parent.
  2. **One child**: return the non-`None` child to link it upward.
  3. **Two children**:
     * Find the **in-order successor** (`_min_value_node(node.right)`)—the smallest key in the right subtree.
     * **Copy** that successor’s key into the current node.
     * **Delete** the successor node from the right subtree (recursive call), thereby removing the duplicate.
#### 5. Finding Minimum (`_min_value_node`)
* Starting at a given node, follow `.left` pointers until you reach a node with no left child.
* That node holds the smallest key in the subtree.

### Summary of What’s Printed
1. **Initial in-order traversal** (after inserting `[50, 30, 20, 40, 70, 60, 80]`):
   ```
   [20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
   ```
   Printed as:
   ```
   Inorder before deletions: [20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
   ```
2. **After deleting 20** (a leaf):
   ```
   [30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
   ```
   Printed as:
   ```
   Inorder after deleting 20 : [30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
   ```
3. **After deleting 30** (now a leaf):
   ```
   [40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
   ```
   Printed as:
   ```
   Inorder after deleting 30 : [40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
   ```
4. **After deleting 50** (node with two children):
   * Successor is 60 (smallest in the right subtree).
   * 50’s key is replaced with 60, then 60 is removed from its original position.
     Resulting traversal:
   ```
   [40, 60, 70, 80]
   ```
   Printed as:
   ```
   Inorder after deleting 50 : [40, 60, 70, 80]
   ```
