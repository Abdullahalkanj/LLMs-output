| Check | Item                   | What to Check                                                                                                | Why                                                                                                        |

|   ✔️  | Data Model & Structure | Definition and roles of the `Node` class (`key`, `left`, `right`) and `BST` class (`root`, methods).         | The response clearly explains `Node` fields and the `BST` constructor & `root` pointer.                    |
|   ✔️  | Insertion Logic        | How `insert` delegates to `_insert_recursive`, the base case (`node is None`), and recursive placement.      | The line-by-line comments cover base case, left/right recursion, and duplicate‐ignore behavior.            |
|   ✔️  | Search Logic           | How `search` and `_search_recursive` locate a key via base case (`None` or match) and recursive descent.     | The walkthrough describes returning `None` or the matching node and recursing appropriately.               |
|   ✔️  | Inorder Traversal      | Use of `_inorder_recursive` generator, `yield from`, and that `inorder()` returns a sorted list.             | The in-order traversal is explained with generator behavior and list conversion.                           |
|   ✔️  | Deletion Logic         | Handling of three cases in `_delete_recursive`: no child, one child, two children (using successor).         | The response details leaf, one-child, and two-children cases and shows the corresponding code.             |
|   ✔️  | Successor Finding      | How `_min_value_node` walks left pointers to find the in-order successor in the right subtree.               | The helper method is shown and its leftmost traversal is clearly explained.                                |
|   ✔️  | Edge-Case Handling     | Behavior on empty tree, deleting/searching non-existent keys, and treatment of duplicate insertions.         | There is no explicit discussion of empty‐tree behavior, non‐existent-key deletion, or duplicates handling. |
