Here’s a structured walkthrough of `countingRadixSort`:

---

### 1. Code Intent

To sort an array of **fixed-length** strings (`arr`) in ascending lexicographical order using a **least-significant-digit (LSD) radix sort**.

* It processes characters from the rightmost position (`stringLen – 1`) down to the leftmost (`0`).
* At each character position it does a **stable counting sort** of the array based on that character.

---

### 2. Function Breakdown

```java
public static void countingRadixSort(String[] arr, int stringLen)
```

* **Parameters**

  * `arr`: the array of strings to sort.
  * `stringLen`: the fixed length of each string in `arr`.

* **Local variables**

  ```java
  final int BUCKETS = 256;      // one bucket for each possible char code (0–255)
  int N = arr.length;           // number of strings
  String[] buffer = new String[N];
  String[] in = arr;            // “input” array reference
  String[] out = buffer;        // “output” array reference
  ```

* **High-level flow**

  1. For each character position `pos` from right to left:

     * Build a frequency table (`count`) of character occurrences at `pos`.
     * Transform it into prefix sums to get starting indices.
     * Scatter (stable) all strings into `out[]` by looking up their bucket index.
     * Swap `in` and `out` so the next pass reads from the newly sorted order.
  2. After all passes, if we ended up with the data in the auxiliary buffer (`out`), copy it back into `arr`.

---

### 3. Logic Behind Loops & Conditions

```java
for (int pos = stringLen - 1; pos >= 0; pos--) {
    int[] count = new int[BUCKETS + 1];
    // 1) Count frequencies:
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
        count[in[i].charAt(pos) + 1]++;

    // 2) Compute prefix sums:
    for (int b = 1; b <= BUCKETS; b++)
        count[b] += count[b - 1];

    // 3) Distribute into out[] (stable):
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
        out[count[in[i].charAt(pos)]++] = in[i];

    // 4) Swap in/out arrays for next iteration:
    String[] tmp = in;
    in = out;
    out = tmp;
}
```

* **Why `BUCKETS + 1` and `charAt(pos) + 1`?**
  Shifting counts by one slot makes the prefix‐sum loop simpler: bucket `b` ends up pointing at the first free index for char code `b`.

* **Stable distribution**
  The third loop walks in increasing index order, placing each string into the next free slot for its character. This stability is crucial so earlier-position sorts don’t get undone by later passes.

---

### 4. Final Copy-Back for Odd Pass Count

```java
if (stringLen % 2 == 1)
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
        out[i] = in[i];
```

* Each pass swaps `in` and `out`.
* If you do an **odd number** of passes, the fully sorted data ends up in the auxiliary buffer (`in` points to it at loop exit), so you must copy it back into the original `arr` (`out` points to `arr`).
* If you do an **even number** of passes, `in` already points at `arr` and no copy is needed.

---

### 5. Edge Cases & Assumptions

* **All strings must be exactly `stringLen` long.**

  * There’s no handling for shorter/longer or `null` strings—calling `charAt(pos)` on a shorter string would throw.
* **Empty array** (`N == 0`) works trivially: all loops do zero iterations.
* **Character set**: assumes 8-bit chars (0–255). If you have Unicode beyond that, you’d need to adjust `BUCKETS`.
* **Stability**: maintained by the counting-sort distribution, ensuring correct lexicographical order.

---

**In summary**, this is a textbook LSD radix sort for fixed-length ASCII (or 8-bit) strings, doing one stable counting sort per character position from right to left, then copying back if needed.
