-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Summary:**
This method implements an in-place **radix sort** for fixed-length strings using **LSD (least significant digit) first** ordering. It repeatedly applies a stable counting sort on each character position, from the last character to the first, to fully sort the array of strings.

---

## 1. Inputs & Outputs

* **Inputs**

  * `String[] arr` – the array of fixed-length strings to be sorted.
  * `int stringLen` – the length of each string in `arr`. All strings must have exactly this length.

* **Outputs**

  * The original array `arr` is sorted in ascending lexicographical order when the method completes.

---

## 2. Line-by-Line Explanation

```java
public static void countingRadixSort(String[] arr, int stringLen) {
    final int BUCKETS = 256;
```

* Define the radix size (`BUCKETS`). Since Java `char` is 16-bit but ASCII fits in 0–255, we use 256 buckets for each possible character value.

```java
    int N = arr.length;
    String[] buffer = new String[N];
    String[] in = arr;
    String[] out = buffer;
```

* `N` is the number of strings.
* Allocate a temporary `buffer` of the same size.
* Use two references `in` and `out` to alternate between source and destination arrays each pass. Initially, source is the original `arr` and destination is the `buffer`.

```java
    for (int pos = stringLen - 1; pos >= 0; pos--) {
```

* Loop over each character position from **rightmost** (`stringLen-1`) down to **leftmost** (`0`).

```java
        int[] count = new int[BUCKETS + 1];
```

* Create a counting array of size 257. We use `+1` to simplify prefix‐sum indexing (shifted by one).

```java
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
            count[in[i].charAt(pos) + 1]++;
```

* **Counting phase:** For each string in the current source (`in`), inspect its character at `pos`, convert to its integer code, and increment `count[code + 1]`. The `+1` shift leaves `count[0]` zero, simplifying later prefix sums.

```java
        for (int b = 1; b <= BUCKETS; b++)
            count[b] += count[b - 1];
```

* **Prefix‐sum phase:** Convert counts into starting indices. After this loop, `count[c]` holds the starting position in `out` for strings whose character at `pos` has code `c`.

```java
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
            out[count[in[i].charAt(pos)]++] = in[i];
```

* **Distribution phase:** Iterate through `in` in original order. For each string, look up its character code at `pos`, find the next free slot in `out` via `count[code]`, place it there, and then increment the count. This preserves stability.

```java
        String[] tmp = in;
        in = out;
        out = tmp;
```

* Swap `in` and `out` for the next pass: the newly sorted-by-this-digit array becomes the source.

```java
    }
```

* End of the loop over positions. After processing all character positions, sorted data resides in `in` if the number of passes (`stringLen`) is even, or in `out` if odd.

```java
    if (stringLen % 2 == 1)
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
            out[i] = in[i];
}
```

* **Final copy (if needed):**
  If `stringLen` is odd, then the last pass wrote sorted data into the `in` array (which is the `buffer`), not the original `arr`. This loop copies the results back into `arr` so that `arr` always ends up sorted on method exit. If `stringLen` is even, the data is already in `arr`, so no copy is needed.

---

### Key points

* **Stable counting sort** on each character ensures overall lexicographical ordering.
* **LSD-first** means we sort by least significant character first, culminating in the most significant.
* **In-place alternation** between two arrays avoids excessive allocations.
* **Bucket size = 256** covers all byte‐valued characters (ASCII/extended).
