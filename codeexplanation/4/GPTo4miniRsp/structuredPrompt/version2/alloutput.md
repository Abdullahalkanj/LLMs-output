**Overview**
This method implements a **least-significant-digit (LSD) radix sort** specialized for fixed‐length strings. It processes the strings one character position at a time (from rightmost character to leftmost), using a counting sort at each step to stably reorder the array based on the current character.

---

## Main Components

1. **Constants & Buffers**

   ```java
   final int BUCKETS = 256;
   int N = arr.length;
   String[] buffer = new String[N];
   String[] in = arr;
   String[] out = buffer;
   ```

   * `BUCKETS`: Number of possible character values (extended ASCII).
   * `buffer`: auxiliary array used for intermediate outputs.
   * `in` / `out`: alternating references so we don’t allocate a new array each pass.

2. **Outer Loop (per character position)**

   ```java
   for (int pos = stringLen - 1; pos >= 0; pos--) { … }
   ```

   Iterates from the last character index (`stringLen-1`) down to `0`, performing one counting sort per character position.

3. **Counting Sort Steps (inside outer loop)**
   a. **Frequency Counting**

   ```java
   int[] count = new int[BUCKETS + 1];
   for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
       count[ in[i].charAt(pos) + 1 ]++;
   ```

   * Builds a frequency histogram of character codes at `pos`.
   * The `+1` offset simplifies later prefix-sum computation.

   b. **Prefix-Sum (Cumulative Counts)**

   ```java
   for (int b = 1; b <= BUCKETS; b++)
       count[b] += count[b - 1];
   ```

   * Transforms `count` into starting indices for each character value in the output array.

   c. **Distribution into Output Buffer**

   ```java
   for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
       out[ count[ in[i].charAt(pos) ]++ ] = in[i];
   ```

   * Places each string into `out` at the position indicated by its character’s prefix sum, then increments that slot.

4. **Swapping Input/Output Arrays**

   ```java
   String[] tmp = in;
   in = out;
   out = tmp;
   ```

   * After each pass, the newly sorted order becomes the “input” for the next character to the left.

5. **Final Copy for Odd Number of Passes**

   ```java
   if (stringLen % 2 == 1)
       for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
           out[i] = in[i];
   ```

   * Because we swap `in` and `out` each pass, if we perform an **odd** number of passes, the fully sorted data resides in `buffer` (not `arr`). This loop copies it back into the original `arr` so that on exit, `arr` holds the sorted strings.

## Key Logic by Section

| Section                     | Purpose                                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bucket setup & buffers**  | Prepares space for counting-sort buckets and an auxiliary array to avoid reallocating on every pass. |
| **Position loop**           | Drives the LSD process, starting from the least significant character.                               |
| **Counting frequencies**    | Tallies how many strings have each ASCII code at the current character position.                     |
| **Building prefix sums**    | Converts counts to cumulative starting indices for stable placement.                                 |
| **Distributing to `out`**   | Places each string into the correct position in the output array, preserving stability.              |
| **Swap `in`/`out`**         | Makes the output of this pass the input for the next pass, without extra allocations.                |
| **Final copy (odd passes)** | Ensures the sorted result ends up in the original array reference.                                   |

## What the Code Produces

* **Side effects**: The original array `arr` is reordered *in place* so that its strings are in **ascending lexicographical order**.
* **Return value**: None (`void`), but upon completion, `arr` contains the sorted data.
* **Printed output**: Nothing. This routine does not print anything itself; it merely rearranges the contents of `arr`.
