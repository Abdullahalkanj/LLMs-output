-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This method is an implementation of a **least-significant-digit (LSD) radix sort** for fixed-length strings. Here’s what it does, step by step:

1. **Setup**

   * `BUCKETS = 256` — one bucket for each possible `char` value in the 0–255 range.
   * `N = arr.length` — the number of strings to sort.
   * `buffer` — an auxiliary array of the same length, used as scratch space.
   * Two references, `in` and `out`, are alternately pointed at the original array `arr` and `buffer` during each pass.

2. **Outer Loop (one pass per character position)**

   ```java
   for (int pos = stringLen - 1; pos >= 0; pos--) { … }
   ```

   We process positions from rightmost (`pos = stringLen−1`) to leftmost (`pos = 0`).

3. **Counting Sort on the `pos`-th Character**

   * **Count occurrences**

     ```java
     int[] count = new int[BUCKETS + 1];
     for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
         count[ in[i].charAt(pos) + 1 ]++;
     ```

     We tally how many strings have each possible character at index `pos`. We shift by +1 so that later we can compute prefix sums easily.

   * **Compute starting indices**

     ```java
     for (int b = 1; b <= BUCKETS; b++)
         count[b] += count[b - 1];
     ```

     After this loop, `count[c]` is the starting index in `out[]` where character code `c`’s block begins.

   * **Distribute into `out[]` stably**

     ```java
     for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
         out[ count[ in[i].charAt(pos) ]++ ] = in[i];
     ```

     We scan the input in original order and place each string into its bucket in `out[]`, incrementing the bucket’s pointer so the next string with the same character goes to the next slot. This preserves stability.

4. **Swap `in` and `out`**

   ```java
   String[] tmp = in;
   in = out;
   out = tmp;
   ```

   Now `in` points to the partially sorted array, ready for the next (more significant) character pass. `out` points to old data, but will be overwritten in the next iteration.

5. **Final Copy (if needed)**
   After doing `stringLen` passes, the fully sorted data may reside in either `arr` or `buffer`, depending on whether we did an even or odd number of passes. If `stringLen` is odd, it ends up in `buffer` (the `out` variable at loop exit), so we copy it back into `arr`:

   ```java
   if (stringLen % 2 == 1)
       for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
           out[i] = in[i];
   ```

### Why LSD Radix Sort?

* **Fixed-length keys**: Works when all strings are exactly `stringLen` characters.
* **Linear time (O(N·L))**: Each of the `L` passes does one linear scan (plus a small constant-size bucket array), giving overall O(N × L).
* **Stable**: Counting sort is stable, so earlier (less significant) orderings are preserved when you sort on more significant characters.

In short, this routine sorts an array of equal-length strings in lexicographical order by repeatedly using counting sort on each character position starting from the end of the string.
