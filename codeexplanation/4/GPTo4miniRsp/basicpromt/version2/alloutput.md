-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let’s step through this Least-Significant-Digit (LSD) radix sort implementation, which sorts fixed-length strings by processing characters from rightmost (least significant) to leftmost (most significant). Here’s a breakdown:

```java
public static void countingRadixSort(String[] arr, int stringLen) {
    final int BUCKETS = 256;
    int N = arr.length;
    String[] buffer = new String[N];
    String[] in = arr;
    String[] out = buffer;

    for (int pos = stringLen - 1; pos >= 0; pos--) {
        int[] count = new int[BUCKETS + 1];

        // 1) Count frequency of each character at position pos
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
            count[in[i].charAt(pos) + 1]++;

        // 2) Transform counts to cumulative indices
        for (int b = 1; b <= BUCKETS; b++)
            count[b] += count[b - 1];

        // 3) Scatter: place each string into out[] in sorted order by this character
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
            out[count[in[i].charAt(pos)]++] = in[i];

        // 4) Swap roles of in and out for next iteration
        String[] tmp = in;
        in = out;
        out = tmp;
    }

    // 5) If we did an odd number of passes, results live in ‘in’ (buffer);
    //    copy back to original array ‘arr’ which is referenced by ‘out’
    if (stringLen % 2 == 1)
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
            out[i] = in[i];
}
```

### 1. Setup

* **`BUCKETS = 256`**
  We assume 8-bit characters, so there are 256 possible values (0–255).

* **`N = arr.length`**
  Number of strings to sort.

* **`buffer`**
  A temporary array of the same size to hold partial results.

* **`in`, `out`**
  References into either `arr` or `buffer`. We alternate (“ping-pong”) between them each pass to avoid allocating a new array on every character.

---

### 2. Main loop over character positions

We run `pos` from `stringLen-1` (rightmost character) down to `0` (leftmost). Each iteration sorts the entire array by the character at index `pos`, *stably* preserving the order of equal keys from previous iterations.

#### a) Counting frequencies

```java
int[] count = new int[BUCKETS + 1];
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    count[in[i].charAt(pos) + 1]++;
```

* We use `+1` so that later when we convert to cumulative counts, `count[c]` will be the starting index for character code `c`.
* After this loop, `count[k+1]` holds the number of strings whose `pos`th character has ASCII code `k`.

#### b) Cumulative counts → starting indices

```java
for (int b = 1; b <= BUCKETS; b++)
    count[b] += count[b - 1];
```

* Now `count[k]` is the total number of strings whose character is `< k`.
* Thus index ranges for character `k` run from `count[k]` to `count[k+1]-1`.

#### c) Scatter into `out[]`

```java
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    out[count[in[i].charAt(pos)]++] = in[i];
```

* We walk `in[]` in order, look at its `pos`th character, find the next free slot in `out[]` for that character via `count[...]`, place the string there, and increment that slot pointer.
* Because we process `in[]` in increasing index order, ties preserve original order → *stable* sort on this digit.

#### d) Swap buffers

```java
String[] tmp = in;
in = out;
out = tmp;
```

* Next pass will read from what we just wrote (`in = out`) and write into the other array (`out = tmp`).

---

### 3. Final copy (odd number of passes)

Because we alternate arrays each pass:

* If `stringLen` is even → after all passes, `in` will end up pointing at the original array `arr`. No copy needed.
* If `stringLen` is odd → after all passes, `in` points at the `buffer` array, so we must copy back into `arr` (which is now referenced by `out`):

```java
if (stringLen % 2 == 1)
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
        out[i] = in[i];
```

---

### Overall complexity

* **Time:** O(`stringLen` × (N + BUCKETS)) per sort.
* **Space:** O(N + BUCKETS).

This LSD radix sort is efficient when all strings have the same fixed length and the alphabet size (here 256) is moderate. It’s stable and runs in linear time in the common case (BUCKETS treated as constant).
