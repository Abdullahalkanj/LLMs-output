The `countingRadixSort` method is an implementation of a **least-significant-digit (LSD) radix sort** for fixed-length strings over the extended ASCII alphabet (256 possible characters). Here’s a step-by-step walkthrough:

1. **Setup**

   ```java
   final int BUCKETS = 256;
   int N = arr.length;
   String[] buffer = new String[N];
   String[] in = arr;
   String[] out = buffer;
   ```

   * `BUCKETS` is the number of possible character values (0–255).
   * `N` is the number of strings.
   * `buffer` is a temporary array of the same size.
   * We use two references, `in` and `out`, which we’ll swap back and forth: initially, `in` points to the original array `arr`, and `out` points to `buffer`.

2. **Process each character position from rightmost to leftmost**

   ```java
   for (int pos = stringLen - 1; pos >= 0; pos--) {
       // …
   }
   ```

   * `stringLen` is the fixed length of all strings.
   * We loop `pos` from the last character index down to 0 (least significant digit first).

3. **Counting sort on the current character**
   Inside the loop for a given `pos`:

   ```java
   int[] count = new int[BUCKETS + 1];
   // 1) Count frequencies
   for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
       count[in[i].charAt(pos) + 1]++;

   // 2) Compute cumulative positions
   for (int b = 1; b <= BUCKETS; b++)
       count[b] += count[b - 1];

   // 3) Distribute into 'out' array
   for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
       out[count[in[i].charAt(pos)]++] = in[i];
   ```

   * **Count frequencies**: We tally how many strings have each character at position `pos`. We shift the index by +1 so that after cumulative sum, `count[c]` gives the starting index in `out` for character code `c`.
   * **Prefix sums**: Transform `count` into starting indices: each `count[b]` becomes the total number of items whose character code is less than `b`.
   * **Scatter**: We place each `in[i]` into `out` at the index given by its character’s bucket, then increment that bucket’s index.

4. **Swap input and output arrays**

   ```java
   String[] tmp = in;
   in = out;
   out = tmp;
   ```

   * After sorting on this digit, the newly ordered array is in `out`; we swap so that next iteration reads from it.

5. **Final copy if needed**

   ```java
   if (stringLen % 2 == 1)
       for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
           out[i] = in[i];
   ```

   * Because we’ve been swapping `in`/`out` each pass, if we did an odd number of passes (`stringLen` is odd), the fully sorted data ends up in `in` (which may be the buffer). This copy puts it back into the original array reference.

---

### What it achieves

* **Stability**: Each counting‐sort pass is stable, preserving order of equal keys from the previous pass.
* **Performance**: Runs in $O(\text{stringLen} \times (N + \text{BUCKETS}))$ time, which is linear when `stringLen` and `BUCKETS` are constants.
* **Use case**: Efficient for sorting many fixed-length strings (e.g., all of length 10) when the alphabet size is moderate.

In short, this is a classic LSD radix sort that sorts an array of equal-length strings by processing characters from right to left, using counting sort as the stable subroutine at each character position.
