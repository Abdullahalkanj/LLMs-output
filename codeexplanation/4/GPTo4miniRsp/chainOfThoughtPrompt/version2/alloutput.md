**Overview**

This method implements a **least-significant-digit (LSD) radix sort** for fixed‐length strings using counting sort as the stable subroutine. Given an array of *N* strings, each of length `stringLen`, it sorts the array lexicographically by processing characters from rightmost (position `stringLen–1`) to leftmost (position 0). Internally it alternates between two string buffers (`in` and `out`) to avoid allocating a fresh array on each pass.

---

### Line-by-Line Explanation

```java
public static void countingRadixSort( String[] arr, int stringLen ) {
    final int BUCKETS = 256;
```

* **Purpose:** Sort `arr` of *N* strings, each exactly `stringLen` characters long.
* **BUCKETS:** Number of possible character values (extended ASCII). We’ll build a count array of size 257 so we can do prefix sums easily.

```java
    int N = arr.length;
    String[] buffer = new String[N];
    String[] in = arr;
    String[] out = buffer;
```

* **N:** Number of strings.
* **buffer:** Temporary array to hold sorted results on each pass.
* **in/out:** Two references that alternate. On each digit pass, we read from `in` and write into `out`, then swap them.

```java
    for( int pos = stringLen - 1; pos >= 0; pos-- ) {
```

* Loop over each character position, from the least significant (`stringLen–1`) down to `0`.

```java
        int[] count = new int[BUCKETS + 1];
```

* **count\[]** of length 257. We’ll use `count[c+1]` to accumulate frequencies of character code `c`, then do a prefix sum so that `count[c]` gives the starting index for character `c`.

```java
        for( int i = 0; i < N; i++ )
            count[ in[i].charAt(pos) + 1 ]++;
```

* **Count frequencies:** For each string `in[i]`, look at its character at position `pos`, get its ASCII code (0–255), and increment `count[code + 1]`. The “+1” shift simplifies turning frequencies into starting indices in the next step.

```java
        for( int b = 1; b <= BUCKETS; b++ )
            count[b] += count[b - 1];
```

* **Transform counts to indices:** After this, `count[c]` holds the total number of input strings whose character at `pos` is strictly less than `c`. This makes the sort **stable**, because we’ll place each string at `out[count[char]]` and then increment `count[char]`.

```java
        for( int i = 0; i < N; i++ )
            out[ count[ in[i].charAt(pos) ]++ ] = in[i];
```

* **Distribute into `out`:** For each string in original order, look up its character `c`, place the string at index `count[c]` in `out`, and then increment `count[c]`. Stability is ensured by processing `i` in increasing order.

```java
        String[] tmp = in;
        in = out;
        out = tmp;
```

* **Swap buffers:** After sorting on this digit, what was `out` becomes the new `in` for the next pass, and vice versa. No data copying required.

```java
    }
```

* Repeat for the next more significant digit.

```java
    if( stringLen % 2 == 1 )
        for( int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++ )
            out[i] = in[i];
}
```

* **Final copy for odd number of passes:**

  * If `stringLen` is **odd**, we’ve swapped buffers an odd number of times, so the fully sorted data resides in `in` (which at method entry pointed to `buffer` after the first swap). But the caller expects the result in `arr`, so we copy from `in` back into `out` (which is the original `arr` reference).
  * If `stringLen` is **even**, the sorted data already lives in `arr` and no copy is needed.

---

### What the Code Produces & Behavior with Different Inputs

* **Correctness:** After execution, `arr` is sorted in **ascending lexicographical** order, assuming:

  1. Every string in `arr` has exactly length `stringLen`.
  2. Characters are in the 0–255 code range.

* **Time complexity:** O(*N* × `stringLen` + *BUCKETS* × `stringLen`), which for fixed `stringLen` is O(*N*). The extra O(*BUCKETS* × `stringLen`) is usually negligible for small alphabets.

* **Space usage:** Two arrays of size *N* plus a count array of size 257. So O(*N* + BUCKETS).

* **Edge cases:**

  * **Empty array (`N=0`):** The loops never execute, and `arr` remains empty.
  * **`stringLen = 0`:** You sort on zero positions. The for-loop on `pos` never runs, and since `0%2==0`, no final copy occurs—`arr` is unchanged (which is correct: zero-length strings are already equal).
  * **Non-uniform string lengths:** Calling `charAt(pos)` on a shorter string throws a `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`. All strings must be exactly `stringLen` long.
  * **Characters outside 0–255:** If you have Unicode codepoints above 255, `charAt` still returns a `char` (0–65535), and indexing count with that value will overflow the 257-element array. You’d need to raise `BUCKETS` accordingly for full Unicode support.

* **Behavior under different inputs:**

  * **Already sorted array:** The algorithm still does all passes but leaves the order intact (stable).
  * **Reverse-sorted array:** It takes the same amount of work, but each pass reverses the current buffer into the other, ending up correctly sorted.
  * **Many duplicates:** Counting sort shines here—duplicates cluster together quickly, and stability preserves original relative order for equal strings.

---

**In summary**, this is a classic in-place LSD radix sort optimized by buffer-swapping and counting sort. It runs in linear time for fixed-length strings, is stable, and works best when all strings share the same length and character set fits within `BUCKETS`.
