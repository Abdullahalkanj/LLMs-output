-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Step 1: Main Purpose**
This method implements a **least-significant-digit (LSD) radix sort** on an array of fixed-length strings. By processing characters from the rightmost position to the leftmost, it groups and orders the strings based on each character in turn, achieving an overall lexicographic sort in O(N + B) time per pass (where B = number of possible character values).

---

**Step 2: Variables and Data Structures**

* `BUCKETS` (constant): set to 256, covering all possible byte-wide character values (0–255).
* `N`: the number of strings in the input array (`arr.length`).
* `buffer`: a temporary array of length N used to hold intermediate sorted results.
* Two references to string arrays:

  * `in` points to the array currently being read from.
  * `out` points to the array being written into.
* Loop indices and helpers:

  * `pos`: current character position, from `stringLen – 1` down to `0`.
  * `count`: an integer array of length `BUCKETS+1` used for counting occurrences and computing prefix sums.
  * `i`, `b`: simple loop counters.
  * `tmp`: a temporary reference for swapping `in` and `out`.

---

**Step 3: Control Flow**

```java
for (int pos = stringLen - 1; pos >= 0; pos--) {
    // 1) Zero the counts
    int[] count = new int[BUCKETS + 1];

    // 2) Count each character at position pos
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
        count[ in[i].charAt(pos) + 1 ]++;

    // 3) Compute prefix sums so count[c] is the starting index for char code c
    for (int b = 1; b <= BUCKETS; b++)
        count[b] += count[b - 1];

    // 4) Distribute strings into 'out' based on the current character
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
        out[ count[ in[i].charAt(pos) ]++ ] = in[i];

    // 5) Swap roles: the output becomes the input for the next pass
    String[] tmp = in;
    in = out;
    out = tmp;
}
```

* **Pass per character**: Each iteration of `pos` fully re-sorts the array by that character, but maintains stability from previous (less significant) passes.
* **Swapping**: By alternating `in` and `out`, we avoid allocating a fresh array each time—just reuse `buffer`.
* **Final parity check**: After all passes, if `stringLen` is odd, the fully sorted data resides in `in` (which points at `buffer`), so it’s copied back into the original `arr` via `out` (which now points to `arr`).

---

**Step 4: Final Result and Why**

* **Result**: The array `arr` ends up lexicographically sorted (ascending), treating each string as exactly `stringLen` characters long.
* **Why it works**:

  * **Stability** of counting sort at each digit ensures that earlier (rightmost) sorts are preserved when you sort by the next (leftward) digit.
  * **LSD first**: You sort on least significant character → then next → … → most significant ensures full lexicographic order.
  * **Odd/even passes**: Because each pass swaps the roles of input and output, after an even number of passes the sorted data is back in the original array; after an odd number it’s in the buffer. The final `if (stringLen % 2 == 1)` handles this by copying buffer back into `arr` only when needed.
