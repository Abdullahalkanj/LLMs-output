-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here’s a step-by-step walkthrough of what this Java method does:

---

**1. Goal of the code**
This method implements a **least-significant-digit (LSD) radix sort** for fixed‐length strings. In other words, given an array `arr` of *N* strings, each of length `stringLen`, it sorts them into ascending lexicographic order in O(N·(R + B)) time, where

* R = `stringLen` (number of character positions),
* B = 256 (size of the character “alphabet,” here assumed to be extended ASCII).

---

**2. Key functions and logic used**

* **Radix passes (outer loop)**

  ```java
  for (int pos = stringLen - 1; pos >= 0; pos--)
      … 
  ```

  We process characters from the least significant (rightmost) `pos = stringLen - 1` to the most significant `pos = 0`.

* **Counting sort on a single character position**

  1. **Frequency count**

     ```java
     for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
         count[ in[i].charAt(pos) + 1 ]++;
     ```

     We build a “shifted” frequency array of size BUCKETS+1, so that later we can turn it directly into prefix sums.

  2. **Prefix sums (cumulative counts)**

     ```java
     for (int b = 1; b <= BUCKETS; b++)
         count[b] += count[b - 1];
     ```

     After this loop, `count[c]` tells you how many strings have character code `< c`.

  3. **Scatter into output buffer**

     ```java
     out[count[ in[i].charAt(pos) ]++] = in[i];
     ```

     Because we use the prefix sums (and increment after placing), this is a **stable** redistribution on that character.

* **Ping‐pong buffers**
  We alternate between two arrays, `in` and `out`, swapping their roles after each pass so that we never allocate a fresh array each time:

  ```java
  String[] tmp = in;
  in = out;
  out = tmp;
  ```

* **Final copy (if needed)**
  If the total number of passes (`stringLen`) is odd, the sorted data ends up in the auxiliary buffer instead of the original `arr`. The last `if` copies it back into `arr`.

---

**3. Execution flow, start to finish**

1. **Initialize**

   * `N = arr.length`
   * `buffer` = new String\[N]
   * `in` points to the original array, `out` to the buffer.

2. **For each character position** `pos = stringLen – 1` down to `0`:
   a. Zero out a fresh count array of length 257 (`BUCKETS + 1`).
   b. Tally how many times each ASCII code appears at `pos` in `in[]`.
   c. Convert that tally into a prefix‐sum array.
   d. Scan `in[]` in order, placing each string into `out[]` at the proper index, incrementing the index so ties remain stable.
   e. Swap `in` and `out`.

3. **Odd‐pass fix**
   If the number of passes was odd, the sorted strings now live in `buffer` (since we flipped an odd number of times). We copy `buffer` back into `arr`. Otherwise, `arr` already holds them.

At the end, `arr` is sorted lexicographically.

---

**4. What happens if inputs change?**

* **Different string lengths**
  If any string isn’t exactly `stringLen` long, calling `charAt(pos)` when `pos` ≥ its length throws a `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`. You’d need to pad shorter strings or guard against that.

* **Larger character set**
  If you had Unicode beyond 0–255, you’d need a larger `BUCKETS` (or map code points down into buckets).

* **Variable `BUCKETS`**
  Changing `BUCKETS` narrows or widens your counting‐sort alphabet: e.g. for only lowercase letters you could use 26 buckets (and shift by `'a'`).

* **Changing stability requirements**
  Radix sort relies on each inner counting sort being **stable**. If you broke stability (for instance, by iterating counts or copies in the wrong order), then the final lexicographic order could be wrong.

* **Very large N or limited memory**
  This version uses O(N) extra space for the buffer and O(B) space for the count array. If memory is tight, you might need an in‐place alternative or to stream data.

---

**Summary**
This is a classic LSD radix‐sort on fixed‐length strings, using counting sort as the stable subroutine at each character position, ping‐ponging between two arrays, and doing a final copy if there’s an odd number of passes. It runs in linear time with respect to the total number of characters (R·N) and uses a small constant‐factor extra space.
