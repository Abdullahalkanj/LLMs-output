|  \[ ] | Algorithm Strategy        | Identification of this as a **least-significant–digit (LSD) radix sort**, iterating `pos` from `stringLen–1` down to `0`. | Captures the high-level approach: sorting by each character position from rightmost to leftmost.            |
|  \[ ] | Counting Array Mechanics  | Creation of `count` of length `BUCKETS+1`, incrementing `count[ in[i].charAt(pos)+1 ]` for each string in `in`.           | Verifies understanding of how counts of each ASCII code are tallied with an extra slot for prefix sums.     |
|  \[ ] | Prefix Sum Computation    | Cumulative sum loop `for b = 1..BUCKETS: count[b] += count[b-1]` turning raw counts into start indices.                   | Ensures the model knows how counts are converted into bucket starting positions for stable distribution.    |
|  \[ ] | Stable Distribution       | Placing `in[i]` into `out[ count[ in[i].charAt(pos) ]++ ]` to maintain relative order of equal keys.                      | Checks that stability (preserving original order among equal characters) is maintained at each pass.        |
|  \[ ] | Buffer Swap Mechanism     | Swapping `in` and `out` via `String[] tmp = in; in = out; out = tmp;` each pass rather than reallocating arrays.          | Confirms awareness of how data is moved between input/output buffers efficiently without extra allocations. |
|  \[ ] | Final Copy for Odd Passes | After all passes, if `stringLen % 2 == 1`, copying `in` back into the original `arr` buffer.                              | Ensures the sorted result ends up in the original array regardless of parity of passes.                     |
