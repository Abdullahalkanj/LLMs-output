This little program defines and exercises a simple **linked‐list-based queue**. Here’s the overall structure and intent:

1. **What it’s trying to do**

   * Provide a `LinkedQueue` class that implements a FIFO queue using a singly linked list.
   * Support the usual operations:

     * `enqueue(e)` to add an element at the tail.
     * `dequeue()` to remove and return the element at the head.
     * `__len__`, `is_empty` to inspect the queue.
   * In the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block, it:

     * Creates a queue
     * Enqueues 10, 20, 30 (printing each action)
     * Dequeues one element (printing the result)
     * Prints the new head’s element and the current size.

### Line-by-line walkthrough

```python
class LinkedQueue:
```

Defines the enclosing queue class.

```python
    class Node:
        def __init__(self, element, next):
            self.element = element
            self.next = next
```

* A **nested** `Node` class to represent each linked‐list node.
* Each node holds:

  * `element`: the stored value
  * `next`: reference to the next node (or `None` if it’s the last).

```python
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None
        self.size = 0
```

* The queue’s constructor initializes an **empty** queue:

  * `head` pointer (front) = `None`
  * `tail` pointer (rear) = `None`
  * `size` counter = 0

```python
    def __len__(self):
        return self.size
```

* Special method so that `len(Q)` returns the current number of elements.

```python
    def is_empty(self):
        return self.size == 0
```

* Returns `True` if there are no elements, else `False`.

```python
    def enqueue(self, e):
        newest = self.Node(e, None)
```

* Create a node containing the new element `e`, with `next=None`.

```python
        if self.is_empty():
            self.head = newest
        else:
            self.tail.next = newest
```

* If the queue was empty, both `head` and `tail` should point to this new node.
* Otherwise, link the current `tail` node’s `next` to the new node.

```python
        self.tail = newest
        self.size += 1
```

* In all cases, update `tail` to be the new node.
* Increment the size counter.

```python
    def dequeue(self):
        if self.is_empty():
            raise Exception('Queue is empty')
```

* If there’s nothing to remove, throw an error.

```python
        answer = self.head.element
        self.head = self.head.next
        self.size -= 1
```

* Save the value from the front node.
* Advance the `head` pointer to the next node.
* Decrement size.

```python
        if self.is_empty():
            self.tail = None
```

* If the queue became empty after removal, also clear `tail` so it doesn’t dangle.

```python
        return answer
```

* Return the removed element.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    Q = LinkedQueue()
```

* Only when run as a script (not when imported), build a new queue.

```python
    for i in [10, 20, 30]:
        print(f"enqueue({i})")
        Q.enqueue(i)
```

* Loop over `[10,20,30]`, printing `enqueue(10)`, etc., then actually enqueueing.

```python
    print("dequeue() ->", Q.dequeue())
```

* Dequeue once (removes 10) and print the returned value.

```python
    print("first remaining ->", Q.head.element if not Q.is_empty() else None)
```

* Peek at the new front: if non‐empty, show `head.element`; otherwise `None`.

```python
    print("current size:", Q.size)
```

* Print how many elements are left.

---

### What actually happens when you run it

The script’s output is:

```
enqueue(10)
enqueue(20)
enqueue(30)
dequeue() -> 10
first remaining -> 20
current size: 2
```

1. **Enqueues** 10, 20, 30 in order.
2. **Dequeues** once, removing **10**.
3. The **first remaining** element is now **20**.
4. **Size** is 2 (elements 20 and 30).

---

### Behavior under different inputs

* **Empty dequeue**

  ```python
  Q = LinkedQueue()
  Q.dequeue()  
  ```

  → raises `Exception('Queue is empty')`.

* **Single element**

  ```python
  Q.enqueue('A')
  x = Q.dequeue()  # returns 'A'
  ```

  → after dequeue, both `head` and `tail` become `None`, `size` goes to 0.

* **More elements**
  Just keeps linking new nodes at the tail; can enqueue and dequeue in any interleaved pattern, always preserving FIFO order.

* **Mixed types**
  You can enqueue any Python object (numbers, strings, even other queues).

---

In essence, this is a textbook implementation of a queue backed by a singly linked list. It handles all edge cases (empty queue on enqueue/dequeue, cleaning up pointers) and provides O(1) time for both enqueue and dequeue.
