|   ✔️  | Data Model & Structure | Definition of the `Node` inner class and the queue attributes `head`, `tail`, and `size`.                                                          | Ensures understanding of how the linked queue is represented and how state is stored.                            |
|   ✔️  | Length & Emptiness     | Correct implementation of `__len__` (returning `size`) and `is_empty` (checking `size == 0`).                                                      | Verifies that the queue exposes its size and empty status accurately.                                            |
|   ✔️  | Enqueue Logic          | Creation of a new node, linking it at the tail, updating `head` if the queue was empty, incrementing `size`.                                       | Ensures elements are enqueued correctly and head/tail pointers are maintained.                                   |
|   ✔️  | Dequeue Logic          | Removing from the head, raising exception if empty, updating `head` and `tail` (when queue becomes empty), decrementing `size`, returning element. | Ensures elements are dequeued correctly, head/tail pointers are updated appropriately, and underflow is handled. |
|   ✔️  | Tail Update on Empty   | Setting `tail = None` in `dequeue` when removing the last element.                                                                                 | Ensures that the queue does not retain stale pointers after becoming empty.                                      |
|   ✔️  | Underflow Exception    | Raising an exception with an appropriate message when `dequeue` is called on an empty queue.                                                       | Confirms robust error handling for illegal operations.                                                           |
|   ✔️  | Demo & Usage           | The `__main__` block correctly enqueues \[10, 20, 30], dequeues one element, and reports the remaining head and size.                              | Validates that the example usage demonstrates the intended behavior and state changes.                           |
