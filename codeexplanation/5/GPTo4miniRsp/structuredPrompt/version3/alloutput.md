Here’s a step-by-step walkthrough of this `LinkedQueue` implementation.

---

**Code Intent (Overall Purpose)**
This class implements a **first-in, first-out (FIFO) queue** using a singly linked list under the hood. You can enqueue elements at the tail and dequeue from the head, all in O(1) time. Size is tracked explicitly.

---

**Class & Data Fields**

```python
class LinkedQueue:
    class Node:
        def __init__(self, element, next):
            self.element = element
            self.next = next
```

* **`Node`**: inner class representing a single linked-list node.

  * `element`: the stored value
  * `next`: reference to the next node or `None`

```python
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None
        self.size = 0
```

* **`head`**: points to the front of the queue
* **`tail`**: points to the end of the queue
* **`size`**: tracks number of elements

---

**`__len__` and `is_empty`**

```python
    def __len__(self):
        return self.size
```

* Returns the current number of elements.

```python
    def is_empty(self):
        return self.size == 0
```

* Simple boolean check for emptiness.

---

**`enqueue(self, e)`**

```python
    newest = self.Node(e, None)
```

* Create a new node holding `e`, with `.next = None` (will become new tail).

```python
    if self.is_empty():
        self.head = newest
    else:
        self.tail.next = newest
```

* **Condition**:

  * **Empty queue** → both `head` and `tail` should point to this first node.
  * **Non-empty queue** → link the old tail’s `.next` to the new node.

```python
    self.tail = newest
    self.size += 1
```

* Update `tail` to the new node and increment `size`.

---

**`dequeue(self)`**

```python
    if self.is_empty():
        raise Exception('Queue is empty')
```

* **Edge case**: attempting to dequeue from an empty queue raises an exception.

```python
    answer = self.head.element
    self.head = self.head.next
    self.size -= 1
```

* Save the value at the front (`head.element`), advance `head` to the next node, decrement `size`.

```python
    if self.is_empty():
        self.tail = None
```

* **Edge case**: if the queue has just become empty (we removed the last element), also clear `tail` so both pointers agree on emptiness.

```python
    return answer
```

* Return the dequeued value.

---

**Main/Test Block**

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    Q = LinkedQueue()
    for i in [10, 20, 30]:
        print(f"enqueue({i})")
        Q.enqueue(i)
    print("dequeue() ->", Q.dequeue())
    print("first remaining ->", Q.head.element if not Q.is_empty() else None)
    print("current size:", Q.size)
```

* **Loop**: enqueues 10, 20, 30 in order.
* **Single dequeue**: removes and prints `10`.
* Then prints the new front (`20`) and the size (`2`).

---

**Logic Behind Loops/Conditions**

* **Enqueue empty vs. non-empty** ensures head is set correctly for the very first element.
* **Dequeue empty check** prevents invalid removal.
* **Post-dequeue tail reset** maintains consistency when the last node is removed.

---

**Edge Cases Handled**

1. **Enqueue into empty queue** → correctly initializes both `head` and `tail`.
2. **Dequeue from empty queue** → raises an exception rather than crashing or returning garbage.
3. **Dequeue last element** → resets `tail` to `None` so subsequent enqueues treat the queue as empty.

---

This implementation offers constant-time enqueue and dequeue, tracks its own size, and properly handles all boundary conditions for an empty vs. non-empty queue.
