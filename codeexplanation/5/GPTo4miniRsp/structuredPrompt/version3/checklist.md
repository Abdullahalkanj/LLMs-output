|   ✔️  | Data Model & Structure | Definition of the `Node` inner class and the queue attributes `head`, `tail`, and `size`.                                                          | The walkthrough clearly explains the `Node` fields and queue state variables.                     |
|   ✔️  | Length & Emptiness     | Correct implementation of `__len__` (returning `size`) and `is_empty` (checking `size == 0`).                                                      | The response describes both `__len__` and `is_empty` methods and their behavior.                  |
|   ✔️  | Enqueue Logic          | Creation of a new node, linking it at the tail, updating `head` if the queue was empty, incrementing `size`.                                       | The enqueue section details node creation, linking logic, tail update, and size increment.        |
|   ✔️  | Dequeue Logic          | Removing from the head, raising exception if empty, updating `head` and `tail` (when queue becomes empty), decrementing `size`, returning element. | The dequeue part covers exception on empty, head advance, size decrement, tail reset, and return. |
|   ✔️  | Tail Update on Empty   | Setting `tail = None` in `dequeue` when removing the last element.                                                                                 | The walkthrough notes resetting `tail` to `None` when the queue becomes empty.                    |
|   ✔️  | Underflow Exception    | Raising an exception with an appropriate message when `dequeue` is called on an empty queue.                                                       | The response includes `raise Exception('Queue is empty')` for underflow.                          |
|   ✔️  | Demo & Usage           | The `__main__` block correctly enqueues \[10, 20, 30], dequeues one element, and reports the remaining head and size.                              | The demo section shows exactly those operations and prints their outcomes.                        |
