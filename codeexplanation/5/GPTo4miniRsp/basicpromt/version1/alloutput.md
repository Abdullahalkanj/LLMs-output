[Insert code here]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This code implements a **queue** data structure using a **singly linked list** under the hood. Let’s break it down piece by piece.

---

### 1. The `Node` inner class

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, element, next):
        self.element = element
        self.next = next
```

* **Purpose**: Represents one “slot” in the linked list.
* **Attributes**:

  * `element`: holds the value stored in this node.
  * `next`: a reference (pointer) to the next node in the list (or `None` if this is the last node).

---

### 2. The `LinkedQueue` class

#### Initialization

```python
def __init__(self):
    self.head = None
    self.tail = None
    self.size = 0
```

* `head`: points to the front node of the queue (where we dequeue from).
* `tail`: points to the last node of the queue (where we enqueue to).
* `size`: keeps track of how many elements are in the queue.

At construction, the queue is empty: both `head` and `tail` are `None`, and `size` is 0.

#### Length and Emptiness Checks

```python
def __len__(self):
    return self.size

def is_empty(self):
    return self.size == 0
```

* `__len__` lets you call `len(Q)` to get the number of elements.
* `is_empty()` returns `True` if there are no elements.

---

### 3. Enqueue (adding to the back)

```python
def enqueue(self, e):
    newest = self.Node(e, None)   # create a new node holding element `e`
    if self.is_empty():
        self.head = newest        # if queue was empty, new node is both head...
    else:
        self.tail.next = newest   # ...otherwise link old tail to new node
    self.tail = newest            # in all cases, update tail to the new node
    self.size += 1
```

* **Time complexity**: O(1) — we only ever manipulate a few pointers.
* We always keep `tail` pointing to the last node, so appending is constant‐time.

---

### 4. Dequeue (removing from the front)

```python
def dequeue(self):
    if self.is_empty():
        raise Exception('Queue is empty')
    answer = self.head.element     # save the element to return
    self.head = self.head.next     # move head pointer to the next node
    self.size -= 1
    if self.is_empty():            # if we just removed the last element...
        self.tail = None           # ...also reset tail to None
    return answer
```

* **Time complexity**: O(1) — again, just pointer adjustments.
* Raises an exception if you try to dequeue from an empty queue.

---

### 5. Demo in the `__main__` block

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    Q = LinkedQueue()
    for i in [10, 20, 30]:
        print(f"enqueue({i})")
        Q.enqueue(i)

    print("dequeue() ->", Q.dequeue())
    print("first remaining ->", Q.head.element if not Q.is_empty() else None)
    print("current size:", Q.size)
```

1. **Enqueue** 10, 20, 30 in order.

   * After these calls, the queue is:

     ```
     head -> [10] -> [20] -> [30] -> None  <- tail
     size == 3
     ```
2. **Dequeue** once.

   * Removes `10` (the head). Returns it and prints `dequeue() -> 10`.
   * New head is the node holding `20`.
3. Print the element at the front (`20`) and the current size (`2`).

---

### Summary

* This is a **linked‐list–based queue** supporting:

  * **Enqueue** (add to back) in O(1)
  * **Dequeue** (remove from front) in O(1)
  * **Size tracking** in O(1)
* Under the hood, a simple `Node` class handles the links, and two pointers (`head`, `tail`) keep operations efficient.
