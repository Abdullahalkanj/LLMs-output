Below is a structured review.

## 1. High-level overview (intended behavior)

The program appears to:

1. Read two integers `N` and `M`.
2. Read `N` horizontal line segments, each given by `(a, b, c)` meaning an x-interval `[a, b]` at fixed y = `c`.
3. Read `M` vertical line segments, each given by `(d, e, f)` meaning a y-interval `[e, f]` at fixed x = `d`.
4. Collect all unique x and y coordinates from the segment endpoints (coordinate compression).
5. Build a fine-grained grid that alternates between **cells** (areas between coordinates) and **edges** (potential walls from the segments).
6. Mark cells separated by the given segments as “blocked” (or, more precisely, mark the edges those segments occupy so flood-fill cannot cross).
7. Flood-fill the region containing the origin `(0,0)` (or nearest compressed cell containing that coordinate), summing up real geometric area of the cells reached.
8. If the flood reaches the bounding box edge (i.e., leaks out to “infinity”), report `INF`; otherwise print the finite enclosed area.

That’s the most coherent interpretation consistent with the code fragments (naming: `x_line`, `y_line`, `get_score`, `search`, use of `INF`).

## 2. Bug list (by user line numbers)

> **Note:** Line numbers below refer to the lines in **your pasted code**, counting every visible line (see annotated reference you gave). Indentation problems are the most severe; Python will not even parse as written.

| #  | Line(s) | Severity                      | Issue                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Notes |
| -- | ------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----- |
| 1  | 7       | **Fatal**                     | `for _ in [ 0 ] * N :` uses a list with dummy values; works but wasteful; idiomatic is `range(N)`. (Not fatal alone; see indentation.)                                                                                                                                                                                               |       |
| 2  | 8-12    | **Fatal**                     | Indentation under the `for` loop is inconsistent/misaligned; Python `IndentationError`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |       |
| 3  | 13      | **Fatal**                     | The loop over `M` verticals is wrongly *nested inside* the `N` loop due to indentation; should be a separate loop after finishing the `N` loop. Currently each vertical set would be re-read `N` times (and as written, syntax error).                                                                                               |       |
| 4  | 14-18   | **Fatal**                     | Same indentation issue; also `sortx.append(d)` is correct, but both `e` and `f` go to `sorty` (ok) yet vertical tuple stored as `(d,e,f)`; fine logically.                                                                                                                                                                           |       |
| 5  | 19      | **Minor (style)/Late import** | Importing `bisect_left` inside a loop unnecessarily; should import once at top.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |       |
| 6  | 20-21   | **Minor**                     | `sorted(list(set(...)))` works but making `list()` is redundant: `sorted(set(sortx))`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |       |
| 7  | 24-28   | **Fatal**                     | Coordinate compression loop for `y_line` mis-indented; local reassignment to `a`/`b`/`c` fine but overshadowing outer names; indentation error.                                                                                                                                                                                      |       |
| 8  | 29-33   | **Fatal**                     | Same for `x_line` loop; also wrongly nested in previous loop in pasted code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |       |
| 9  | 34-35   | **Logic**                     | `W = len(sortx)*2 - 1` etc: This pattern is common in grid-doubling schemes (cells on odd indices, edges on even), but must be computed *before* using compressed lines in marking; here it comes after loops but inside indentation block in pasted text -> parse error.                                                            |       |
| 10 | 36      | **Fatal Logic**               | `G = [ 1 ] * W * H + [ 0 ] * ( W + 1 )`: operator precedence leads to `[1]*W*H` => `[1]*(W*H)`; then extend with extra zeros; total size wrong (should be exactly `W*H`).                                                                                                                                                            |       |
| 11 | 37-44   | **Fatal**                     | `make_graph` defined, but immediately followed by unindented `for` loops that *look* like part of the function yet are not (indentation). Intended behavior: after building `G`, iterate over compressed segments and call `make_graph` across their spans to mark blocked edges. As written: syntax error + recursion misuse.       |       |
| 12 | 38      | **Logic**                     | `make_graph(i,j,s=0)` writes a *single* grid cell; but later used in loops that repeatedly call it to mark many cells—OK—yet the default `s=0` means “clear/unpassable/visited”? Ambiguous. When flood-fill also calls `make_graph` to mark visited, we conflate “wall” and “visited”. Need two states or separate marking.          |       |
| 13 | 45-53   | **Fatal**                     | `get_score` indentation broken; `' inf '` spacing odd but still accepted; but you want `float('inf')`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |       |
| 14 | 46      | **Bug**                       | Boundary check `i <= 0`/`j <= 0`: valid index 0 exists; returning `inf` for row/col 0 may incorrectly flag finite areas as infinite if starting there. Should check `<0` or `>=W` etc.                                                                                                                                               |       |
| 15 | 48      | **Logic**                     | Condition `elif i % 2 and j % 2:` counts *odd* indices as cells; consistent only if you used `W = 2*len-1` scheme and placed cells on even or odd consistently. Must ensure indices line up with earlier marking loops; currently loops use `range(2*a,2*b+1)` mixing parity; off-by-one risks.                                      |       |
| 16 | 54      | **Style/Logic**               | `dic` defined *inside* indentation of `get_score` block in pasted code; should be module-level constant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |       |
| 17 | 55-60   | **Fatal**                     | `search` indentation; early `return res` inside loop (line 60) returns after checking first neighbor; should return after loop.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |       |
| 18 | 57-59   | **Bug**                       | No bounds check on `(i+dx, j+dy)` before indexing into `G`; may IndexError.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |       |
| 19 | 61      | **Bug**                       | Initial `stack` coordinate: `( 2 * bl(sortx,0) - 1 , 2 * bl(sorty,0) - 1 )`. If `0` is first coordinate, `bl` returns 0, giving `(-1,-1)` → out of range. Should start at cell containing (0,0) if within coordinate set, else use insertion index logic.                                                                            |       |
| 20 | 62      | **Style**                     | Reusing `res` (area) after previously used as list in `search` may confuse readers; different scopes but name collision risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |       |
| 21 | 63-70   | **Fatal**                     | Main flood loop indentation; mixture of tabs/spaces? Several lines mis-aligned; Python error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |       |
| 22 | 66      | **Bug**                       | `continue` aligned incorrectly; may not be in intended block; also skipping visited is fine but we must differentiate visited vs wall vs unvisited.                                                                                                                                                                                  |       |
| 23 | 68      | **Bug**                       | `stack += search(x,y)` extends with neighbors (OK) but `search` returns list; if we re-visit we need marking *before* pushing to avoid duplicates (stack blowup).                                                                                                                                                                    |       |

## 3. Corrected version

Below is a cleaned, runnable version that (a) parses input; (b) collects segments; (c) coordinate-compresses; (d) builds a doubled grid; (e) marks *edges* blocked; (f) flood-fills from the cell containing `(0,0)`; (g) sums enclosed area; (h) prints `INF` if flood reaches outer boundary.

**Assumptions I had to make (please confirm):**

* Horizontal segment `(a,b,c)` blocks passage along y = c from x ∈ \[a,b].
* Vertical segment `(d,e,f)` blocks passage along x = d from y ∈ \[e,f].
* Input endpoints inclusive.
* We include the coordinate `0` in both compressed axes so we can start flood from origin.
* If flood reaches outside the outermost coordinates, region is unbounded → `INF`.
* Segments act as *closed walls* along their span; movement allowed N/S/E/W between adjacent cells unless a wall edge intervenes.

If any of these differ from your intent, let me know and I’ll adjust.

### Key fixes annotated

* **Lines 1-2:** Replaced lambda with explicit function `read_ints()` for clarity & reusability.
* **Input loops:** Separate loops for horizontal and vertical segments; normalize endpoint order.
* **Add origin (0,0)** to coordinate sets so start cell is representable.
* **Coordinate maps** `xi`, `yi` for O(1) lookup instead of repeated `bisect_left`.
* **Grid sizing** corrected: `W = 2*len(xs) - 1`, `H = 2*len(ys) - 1`.
* **Blocked grid** 2D list (not flattened 1D with arithmetic) for readability; mark edges for each segment.
* **cell\_area()** computes geometric area from adjacent coords.
* **can\_move()** checks whether edge between cells is blocked.
* **Start cell** computed using `bisect_left`; handles case where origin aligns exactly with coordinate.
* **Flood fill** with explicit `visited` matrix rather than overloading wall/visited states in a single array.
* **Detect infinity** by seeing if reachable region touches outer bounding frame (`touches_border = True`). You could also extend coords with huge sentinels and test hitting them.
* **Final print** prints `"INF"` when unbounded; otherwise prints numeric area.

### 4. Next steps / questions for you

1. **Segment semantics:** Are endpoints inclusive? Do they represent closed walls, or merely lines you can cross at endpoints? (I assumed closed.)
2. **Origin:** Should the region always be measured from `(0,0)`? Or from the *first* input point? If different, let me know.
3. **Multiple test cases?** If input can contain several cases, we need to wrap in a loop.

Let me know and I can tailor the code further.
