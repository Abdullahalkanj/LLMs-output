Here’s a careful pass through the code, broken into three parts as requested.

---

### 1. Bugs Found

1. **Indentation / Syntax Errors**

   * Many `for`-loops, `def`-lines and their bodies are mis-indented.
   * The `import bisect` is indented inside a loop and thus unreachable.
   * As written, this will raise `IndentationError` at parse time.

2. **Incorrect Graph-Array Initialization**

   ```python
   G = [ 1 ] * W * H + [ 0 ] * ( W + 1 )
   ```

   Due to operator precedence, this builds:

   * `[1] * W` first, then that list multiplied by `H`, then concatenated with `[0] * (W+1)`.
   * That’s almost certainly not the intended shape of a “W×H grid plus margins.”

3. **Wrong `return` in `search()`**

   ```python
   for dx, dy in dic:
       if …:
           res.append(...)
           return res
   ```

   The `return` inside the loop makes it bail out after checking only the *first* direction.

4. **Typo in `float(' inf ')`**
   The string has spaces: `' inf '` → `ValueError: could not convert string to float`.

5. **Boundary Check in `get_score()`**

   ```python
   if i <= 0 or j <= 0 or i >= W or j >= H:
       return float('inf')
   ```

   This incorrectly treats `i=0` or `j=0` as *out* of bounds, whereas valid indices do run from 0 to W–1 (and 0 to H–1).

6. **Start-Position Calculation May Be Wrong**

   ```python
   start = (2*bl(sortx, 0) - 1, 2*bl(sorty, 0) - 1)
   ```

   If `0` isn’t *actually* in `sortx`, `bisect_left` gives an insertion index, not the exact coordinate.

7. **Mixed‐up Coordinate Lists**
   In one block, the code does:

   ```python
   for d,e,f in x_line:
       d = bl(sortx, d)
       e = bl(sorty, e)   # <-- should be bl(sortx, e) if e is x-coordinate
       f = bl(sorty, f)
   ```

   Here *both* `d` and `e` get bisected into the wrong axis arrays.

8. **`make_graph` and Loop Nesting**
   The loops that call `make_graph` on every edge are wrongly nested; they never actually run over all edges.

---

### 2. Simple Causes

* **Indentation**: Python relies on whitespace. Misaligned blocks simply won’t compile.
* **List-Multiplication Precedence**: `*` is left-associative. You meant “one big list of size W×H plus a border,” but Python did something else.
* **Early `return`**: Putting `return` inside a loop means “exit the function immediately,” not “after I’ve collected them all.”
* **String Spacing**: `float()` won’t trim inner spaces.
* **Off-by-One Checks**: You accidentally excluded index 0 as “out of bounds.”
* **Bisect Usage**: `bisect_left` finds insertion points; you used it both for coordinate compression *and* for locating an existing coordinate.
* **Axis Mix-up**: You used `sorty` for both the `e` (x) and `f` (y) coordinates in the second batch.
* **Function Nesting**: You indented the import *and* your loops inside other loops, so they never run in the intended order.

### 3. Corrected Code

```python
from bisect import bisect_left as bl

# Fast input
g = lambda: map(int, input().split())

# Read N (horizontal segments) and M (vertical segments)
N, M = g()

# We'll collect all x- and y-coordinates for compression:
xs, ys = [], []
horiz_segments = []
vert_segments  = []

# Read horizontal ("y_line") segments: given as (x1, x2, y)
for _ in range(N):
    x1, x2, y = g()
    xs += [x1, x2]
    ys.append(y)
    horiz_segments.append((x1, x2, y))

    x, y1, y2 = g()
    xs.append(x)
    ys += [y1, y2]
    vert_segments.append((x, y1, y2))

# Deduplicate and sort for coordinate compression

    for i in range(2*i1, 2*i2 + 1):
        set_cell(i, row, 0)

# Block out the edges of every vertical segment:

    col = 2*i
    for j in range(2*j1, 2*j2 + 1):
        set_cell(col, j, 0)

    # Only face-centers (odd,odd) contribute:

        dx = xs[(i+1)//2] - xs[(i-1)//2]
        dy = ys[(j+1)//2] - ys[(j-1)//2]
        return dx * dy
    return 0

def neighbors(i, j):
    """Return all open neighbor cells (no premature return!)."""
    result = []
    for di, dj in dirs:
        ni, nj = i+di, j+dj
        if in_bounds(ni, nj) and G[ni + nj*W] == 1:

    return result

def flood_fill(start_i, start_j):

        i, j = stack.pop()
        if G[i + j*W] != 1:
            continue
        # mark visited
        set_cell(i, j, 0)
        # add area if this is a face
        total += get_score(i, j)

        for ni, nj in neighbors(i, j):
            stack.append((ni, nj))

# If that lands on a wall, we step one back
if not in_bounds(start_i, start_j) or G[start_i + start_j*W] == 0:
    start_i = max(0, min(W-1, start_i-1))

res = flood_fill(start_i, start_j)

print(res if res < float('inf') else 'INF')
```

#### Key Fixes (comments inline)

* **Proper indentation** everywhere so Python will parse it.
* **Coordinate compression**: We use two separate lists `xs, ys`.
* **Graph size**: `G = [1] * (W*H)` gives exactly one cell per grid point.
* **`set_cell` helper** to hide the flat-index math.
* **Blocking edges** loops are now at top-level, not nested inside each other.
* **`get_score`**:

  * Checks `in_bounds` with `0 ≤ i < W`, etc.
  * Uses `float('inf')` correctly.
* **`neighbors()`** collects *all* valid neighbors before returning.
* **`flood_fill()`** both accumulates area and marks visited.
* **Start-point logic**:

  * Bisects `0` into each axis; if it lands on a wall, step one cell inward.

With these changes, the code should run without syntax errors, properly build the graph, and compute the finite enclosed area (or report `"INF"`).
