**1. What the code is supposed to do overall**
The program reads **N** horizontal “walls” and **M** vertical “walls” on the plane, builds a compressed grid where each 1×1 “cell” corresponds to a rectangle between consecutive *x* and *y* coordinates, then performs a flood-fill from the cell containing the origin to compute the total accessible area. If the region is unbounded it should print `INF`, otherwise the finite total area.

**2. Step-by-step through the original logic**

```python
g = lambda : map(int, input().split())
N, M = g()
# 1. Collect all x- and y-coordinates and raw wall segments
sortx, sorty = [], []
y_line, x_line = [], []
for _ in [0]*N:
    a, b, c = g()              # horizontal wall from x=a..b at y=c
    sortx += [a, b]
    sorty.append(c)
    y_line.append((a,b,c))
    for _ in [0]*M:            # …but this loop is nested INSIDE the N-loop by mistake
        d, e, f = g()
        sortx.append(d)
        sorty += [e,f]
        x_line.append((d,e,f))
# 2. Deduplicate & sort the coordinates
sortx = sorted(set(sortx))
sorty = sorted(set(sorty))
# 3. Compress coordinates via bisect
from bisect import bisect_left as bl
zip_y_line, zip_x_line = [], []
for a,b,c in y_line:
    a = bl(sortx, a);  b = bl(sortx, b);  c = bl(sorty, c)
    zip_y_line.append((a,b,c))
    for d,e,f in x_line:      # ← also mistakenly nested
        d = bl(sortx, d)
        e = bl(sorty, e)
        f = bl(sorty, f)
        zip_x_line.append((d,e,f))
# 4. Build a 2D grid G of size (2*len(sortx)-1)×(2*len(sorty)-1), initialized to 1 (open)
W = len(sortx)*2 - 1
H = len(sorty)*2 - 1
G = [1] * W * H + [0] * (W + 1)   # ← incorrect initialization
# 5. Carve out wall‐edges (set those grid‐cells to 0)
def make_graph(i, j, s=0):
    G[i + j*W] = s
for a,b,c in zip_y_line:
    for i in range(2*a, 2*b+1):
        make_graph(i, 2*c)
    for d,e,f in zip_x_line:
        for j in range(2*e, 2*f+1):
            make_graph(2*d, j)
# 6. Define scoring: only “actual area cells” (odd,odd) contribute dx*dy
def get_score(i,j):
    if i<=0 or j<=0 or i>=W or j>=H:
        return float('inf')
    elif i%2 and j%2:
        dx = sortx[(i+1)//2] - sortx[(i-1)//2]
        dy = sorty[(j+1)//2] - sorty[(j-1)//2]
        return dx*dy
    else:
        return 0
# 7. Flood-fill from origin’s cell, summing get_score
dic = [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)]
def search(i,j):
    res = []
    for dx,dy in dic:
        if G[(i+dx)+(j+dy)*W] == 1:
            res.append((i+dx, j+dy))
            return res            # ← returns after first neighbor only!
stack = [(2*bl(sortx,0)-1, 2*bl(sorty,0)-1)]
res = 0
while stack:
    x, y = stack.pop()
    if G[x+y*W] != 1:
        continue
    res += get_score(x,y)
    stack += search(x,y)
    make_graph(x,y)           # mark visited
print(res if res < float('inf') else 'INF')
```

**3. Where the logic breaks / bugs introduced**

1. **Indentation & loop‐nesting**

   * The `for _ in [0]*M` loop reading vertical walls is nested inside the horizontal‐walls loop, so you only read `M` vertical walls *for each* of the `N` horizontals instead of once.
   * Similarly, the building of `zip_x_line` is wrongly indented under the horizontal‐walls loop.

2. **Grid initialization**

   ```python
   G = [1] * W * H + [0] * (W + 1)
   ```

   This yields a list of length `W*H + (W+1)`, not `W*H`.

3. **`search()` returns too early**

   ```python
   for dx,dy in dic:
       if G[...] == 1:
           res.append(...)
           return res
   ```

   The `return` is inside the loop, so you only ever return *one* neighbor, not *all* reachable neighbors.

4. **Boundary checks in `get_score`**

   * The test `i>=W or j>=H` should be `i>=W-1 or j>=H-1` (since valid indices run `0..W-1`, `0..H-1`).
   * The literal string `' inf '` gets passed to `float()` but with extra spaces—while `float(' inf ')` actually works, it’s against style and invites confusion.

5. **Marking visited cells**

   * In the main loop you call `make_graph(x,y)` only *after* pushing neighbors onto the stack.  If two different cells both see `(x,y)` as a neighbor before it’s marked, you’ll enqueue `(x,y)` twice, leading to wasted work (though not incorrectness in this particular algorithm).

---

**4. Why each is a problem**

* **Mis‐nested loops** → you don’t read the intended number of segments.
* **Wrong length for `G`** → index‐out‐of‐bounds or unmarked walls, corrupting the grid.
* **Premature `return` in `search()`** → you fail to explore all four directions, so your flood fill is incomplete.
* **Off‐by‐one in boundary checks** → you may treat edge cells as infinite when they’re actually valid finite cells (or vice versa).
* **Delayed marking** → inefficiency and potential infinite loops in other contexts.

**5. Corrected version**

**6. Explanation of the key changes**

| Change                                                                 | Reasoning                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Split the two `for` loops** reading horizontal vs. vertical walls    | They were wrongly nested, so you only read *M* vertical walls per horizontal line.                 |
| **`G = [1] * (W*H)`** instead of adding `+[0]*(W+1)`                   | Ensures the grid array has exactly *W×H* cells.                                                    |
| **`mark()` helper** to  set cells to 0                                 | Clarifies that “0” means wall/visited; avoids retyping the index arithmetic.                       |
| **Move horizontal‐ and vertical‐wall carving into two separate loops** | Avoids mis‐nesting and ensures all walls get marked.                                               |
| **`get_score` boundary check: `i >= W-1` and `j >= H-1`**              | Valid indices go from 0…*W-1*; on the last index (edge), we treat it as unbounded territory.       |
| **`neighbors()` collects *all* 4 valid neighbors before returning**    | The original `return` inside the loop only ever returned the *first* neighbor found.               |
| **Mark each cell visited *before* pushing its neighbors**              | Prevents re-visiting the same cell multiple times, making the flood‐fill safer and more efficient. |

With these changes the code correctly reads exactly *N*+*M* segments, compresses coordinates, builds the wall‐masked grid, and flood-fills to compute the reachable area (or reports `INF`).
