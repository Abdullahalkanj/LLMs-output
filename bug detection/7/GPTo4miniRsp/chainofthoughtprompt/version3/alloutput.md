Below is a concise, high-level review and a corrected version of your script. I’ve hidden my private “thinking out loud” and instead present just the distilled issues, fixes, and the revised code.

---

### 1. What the code is *trying* to do

* Read two sets of line segments: **N** horizontal lines (with y-coordinates) and **M** vertical lines (with x-coordinates).
* Coordinate-compress both axes.
* Build a grid graph where walls (the input segments) remove edges.
* Flood-fill from the origin cell and sum up the total “area” of reachable cells.
* Print the area, or “INF” if it’s unbounded.

### 2. Key issues & fixes

| Issue                              | Why it’s wrong/risky                                                                                      | Fix                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Indentation & loop nesting**     | The `for _ in [0]*M:` is nested inside the N-loop by mistake, so you read `M` vertical lines **N times**. | Un-nest the vertical-segment loop so each group runs exactly once.                                  |
| **Premature `return` in `search`** | The `return` inside the `for` makes `search` only ever return the *first* neighbor.                       | Move `return` outside the loop (or build a list of *all* neighbors).                                |
| **Grid initialization**            | `G = [1] * W * H + [0] * (W + 1)` is clever but confusing, and the extra zeros are a hack for boundaries. | Use a 2D list or a single list of size `W*H` and handle boundaries explicitly.                      |
| **Flood-fill logic**               | Mixing `stack += search…` with in-place marking can skip cells or revisit.                                | Use a standard DFS/BFS pattern: pop, skip if visited or blocked, mark visited, add *all* neighbors. |
| **Bisect arguments**               | You passed `(list, value)` correctly, but make sure you’re bisecting on the right sorted list.            | Confirm you’re using `bisect_left(sorted_list, coord)` on the correct list.                         |

#### Why these fixes matter

1. **Correct loop structure** guarantees you read exactly **N** horizontal and **M** vertical segments.
2. **Explicit wall-blocking** on a flat array is simpler than mixing extra zeros at the array’s end.
3. **Standard DFS/BFS** avoids skipping or revisiting cells and handles unbounded areas cleanly.
4. **Clear boundary checks** in `cell_area` immediately detect an infinite region.

This revision is robust, readable, and should behave as you originally intended.
