------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below is a structured debug walk-through. I’ll first restate the intent (what the program *seems* to be trying to do), then line-by-line logic, then problems, then a cleaned, working version with explanations of the fixes.

---

## 1. What is this code trying to achieve?

It appears to solve a “find the area of the region containing (0,0) in a plane with axis-aligned segment walls” style problem (common in programming contests).

* Input:

  * `N` horizontal segments: each given by `(a, b, c)` meaning a wall from x=a to x=b at y=c.
  * `M` vertical segments: each `(d, e, f)` meaning a wall from y=e to y=f at x=d.
* The plane is partitioned by these line segments into (possibly many) rectangular cells.
* We want the *finite* area reachable from the coordinate (0,0) *without crossing walls*.
* If that reachable region is unbounded, print `INF`; otherwise print its total area.

The program performs **coordinate compression** to shrink the continuous plane to a grid whose nodes/edges represent the segments and gaps, builds a blocked/open grid, then does a flood fill from the compressed cell containing (0,0). While flood-filling, it accumulates physical area from the original coordinates. If the exploration walks off the bounding box (i.e., reaches an “outside” sentinel), the region is unbounded → `INF`.

---

## 2. Walk through the code logic (intended)

Below I rewrite the code conceptually and annotate what each part is *supposed* to mean. I’ll ignore the indentation damage in the buggy listing for the moment.

```python
g = lambda: map(int, input().split())
N, M = g()
sortx = []
sorty = []
y_line = []   # store horizontal walls (a,b,c)
x_line = []   # store vertical walls (d,e,f)

for _ in [0] * N:
    a, b, c = g()
    sortx.append(a); sortx.append(b)
    sorty.append(c)
    y_line.append((a, b, c))

for _ in [0] * M:
    d, e, f = g()
    sortx.append(d)
    sorty.append(e); sorty.append(f)
    x_line.append((d, e, f))

from bisect import bisect_left as bl

# Coordinate compression: unique sorted coords
sortx = sorted(set(sortx))
sorty = sorted(set(sorty))

zip_x_line = []
zip_y_line = []

# compress horizontal walls
for a, b, c in y_line:
    a = bl(sortx, a)
    b = bl(sortx, b)
    c = bl(sorty, c)
    zip_y_line.append((a, b, c))

# compress vertical walls
for d, e, f in x_line:
    d = bl(sortx, d)
    e = bl(sorty, e)
    f = bl(sorty, f)
    zip_x_line.append((d, e, f))

# Expanded grid dimensions:
# in compressed coordinates there are len(sortx) columns of *lines*;
# between them lie cells. To represent both cell centers and wall positions,
# the trick used is thickness-1 / doubled indexing.
W = len(sortx) * 2 - 1
H = len(sorty) * 2 - 1

# Grid G: 1 means unvisited open; 0 means blocked (wall) or visited after flood fill.
G = [1] * (W * H)

def make_graph(i, j, s=0):
    # mark a grid point as blocked/visited (set to s; default 0)
    G[i + j * W] = s

# Lay down horizontal walls:
for a, b, c in zip_y_line:
    # Horizontal wall at compressed y=c spans x indices a..b
    for i in range(2*a, 2*b + 1):
        make_graph(i, 2*c)

# Lay down vertical walls:
for d, e, f in zip_x_line:
    # Vertical wall at compressed x=d spans y indices e..f
    for j in range(2*e, 2*f + 1):
        make_graph(2*d, j)
```

Now the scoring (area per cell):

```python
def get_score(i, j):
    # If outside grid, that means unbounded region → return INF contribution
    if i <= 0 or j <= 0 or i >= W or j >= H:
        return float('inf')
    # Only count actual *cells* at odd,odd indices (between walls)
    elif i % 2 and j % 2:
        dx = sortx[(i + 1)//2] - sortx[(i - 1)//2]
        dy = sorty[(j + 1)//2] - sorty[(j - 1)//2]
        return dx * dy
    else:
        return 0
```

Neighbor directions:

```python
dic = [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)]
```

Return unvisited open neighbors:

```python
def search(i, j):
    res = []
    for dx, dy in dic:
        ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy
        if 0 <= ni < W and 0 <= nj < H and G[ni + nj*W] == 1:
            res.append((ni, nj))
    return res
```

Flood-fill stack seeded with compressed index for (0,0). The original attempts:

```python
stack = [(2*bl(sortx,0)-1, 2*bl(sorty,0)-1)]
res = 0
while stack:
    x,y = stack.pop()
    if G[x + y*W] != 1:
        continue
    res += get_score(x,y)
    stack += search(x,y)
    make_graph(x,y)          # mark visited
print(res if res < float('inf') else 'INF')
```

Intended behavior: Start from the cell containing coordinate 0 in both axes, explore reachable area; if at any point `get_score` returns `inf` (i.e., we touched outside boundary), result becomes `inf` and we print `INF`.

---

## 3. Where things go wrong

There are *many* problems in the supplied “buggy” version. Key ones:

### A. Catastrophic indentation corruption

Almost every block is mis-indented. As pasted, the code will not run at all (IndentationError). I assume that’s due to copy formatting; but if this is truly the submitted version, Python would crash immediately.

### B. Mixing data-collection loops (the `for` loops are nested accidentally)

In the buggy paste, the `for _ in [0] * M:` loop appears indented under the `for _ in [0] * N:` loop, which would cause the vertical lines to be read *inside* the horizontal loop. That means you’d read `M` lines `N` times, and your data arrays would blow up (and you’d consume far too much input / crash). They must be **separate** top-level loops.

The same nesting problem recurs later when laying out walls: the vertical-wall build loop is indented under the horizontal loop.

### C. Grid initialization is wrong

```python
G = [1] * W * H + [0] * (W + 1)
```

Because of operator precedence, `[1] * W * H` actually gives `[1] * (W * H)` (fine) but then concatenates `[0]*(W+1)`, producing an array **longer** than `W*H`. That hides out-of-range index bugs and leaves trailing zeros (blocked cells) that aren’t part of the grid. Should just be:

```python
G = [1] * (W * H)
```

### D. No *padding* coordinates → can’t detect unbounded properly

To detect that the reachable region is open to infinity, you need an **outer frame** so flood fill can “escape.” Typical fix: before compressing coordinates, add sentinels smaller than min(coord) and larger than max(coord) (e.g., `-INF_BOUND`, `+INF_BOUND`), or simply `(min-1)` and `(max+1)` extremes. Without them, every region looks bounded by the min/max coordinate list; `get_score` outside check will never trigger (or will mis-trigger if you start on index boundaries). The current code tries to lean on `i <= 0 or j <= 0 or i >= W or j >= H`, but since flood fill never goes out of `[0..W-1]`, you’ll never see `inf` unless you start wrongly.

### E. Incorrect starting cell index

```python
stack = [ (2 * bl(sortx, 0) - 1, 2 * bl(sorty, 0) - 1) ]
```

`bisect_left(sortx, 0)` returns the insertion point for 0; if 0 is the *first* compressed x (index 0), this produces `2*0-1 = -1`, an invalid grid coordinate. If index > 0 you land on an *edge* location, not a cell center. You need to start in the *cell that contains x=0,y=0*, which corresponds to the odd grid index just *before* the first compressed coord greater than 0. A helper is safer (see fix below).

### F. Bounds checking missing in `search`

The buggy listing indexes neighbors without checking `0 <= ni < W`, etc. That can read outside `G` and crash.

### G. `get_score` boundary condition off by one

`if i <= 0 or j <= 0 or i >= W or j >= H:` incorrectly treats `(0,*)` and `(*,0)` as “outside,” but index 0 is a valid grid coordinate (outermost line). It *might* be intended to mark reaching the outer frame; but then we must include sentinel frame lines so that hitting them means open boundary. As written, flood fill from start may instantly mark `inf`. Needs redesign with explicit frame.

### H. Misuse of `float(' inf ')` (spaces)

`float(' inf ')` works (Python strips whitespace) but is brittle and ugly; safer is `math.inf` or `float('inf')`.

### I. `make_graph()` is used both for building walls and marking visited

This is okay in principle (shared helper), but the default `s=0` means “blocked.” That’s fine for walls, but when marking visited we also use 0, making visited indistinguishable from wall in later passes. That’s acceptable because we only need to avoid re-visiting; just keep in mind.

### J. Horizontal wall range inclusive?

`for i in range(2*a, 2*b + 1):` is intended to cover the line *and* the boundary at the endpoint. Usually, when representing segments between compressed coordinates `a` and `b`, you want to convert to the doubled grid as `2*a` to `2*b` **step 1** inclusive—*if* the original segment is closed at both ends. That’s fine, but you must ensure `a < b` and the `+1` doesn’t run past width. Safer: `range(2*a, 2*b + 1)` only works if `2*b` < `W`; with padding we guarantee that.

---

## 4. Suggested fix (clean, working version)

Below is a corrected, reasonably compact solution that implements the intended algorithm safely. I’ve added sentinel padding so unbounded areas are detected. I also separated building and visiting grids for clarity (optional but safer). Comments inline.

```python
import sys
from bisect import bisect_left

input = sys.stdin.readline

def readints():
    return map(int, input().split())

N, M = map(int, input().split())

h_segments = []  # horizontal walls (a,b,c)  x-range [a,b), at y=c
v_segments = []  # vertical walls (d,e,f)    y-range [e,f), at x=d
xs = []
ys = []

for _ in range(N):
    a, b, c = readints()
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    h_segments.append((a, b, c))
    xs.extend([a, b])
    ys.append(c)

for _ in range(M):
    d, e, f = readints()
    if e > f:
        e, f = f, e
    v_segments.append((d, e, f))
    xs.append(d)
    ys.extend([e, f])

# --- padding so we can detect escape to infinity ---
# choose values strictly outside given coord ranges
INF_PAD = 10**10  # sufficiently large
xs.extend([-INF_PAD, INF_PAD])
ys.extend([-INF_PAD, INF_PAD])

xs = sorted(set(xs))
ys = sorted(set(ys))

# coordinate -> compressed index
def idx_x(x): return bisect_left(xs, x)
def idx_y(y): return bisect_left(ys, y)

# compress segments
h_comp = [(idx_x(a), idx_x(b), idx_y(c)) for a,b,c in h_segments]
v_comp = [(idx_x(d), idx_y(e), idx_y(f)) for d,e,f in v_segments]

# doubled grid sizes
W = len(xs)*2 - 1
H = len(ys)*2 - 1

# grid meaning:
# even index = line (coordinate)
# odd index  = cell gap between coordinates
OPEN = 1
BLOCKED = 0
grid = [OPEN] * (W * H)

def block(i, j):
    grid[i + j*W] = BLOCKED

# lay horizontal walls
for a, b, c in h_comp:
    y = 2*c
    for i in range(2*a, 2*b + 1):
        block(i, y)

# lay vertical walls
for d, e, f in v_comp:
    x = 2*d
    for j in range(2*e, 2*f + 1):
        block(x, j)

# area lookup for cell center at odd,odd index
def cell_area(i, j):
    # if outside (shouldn't happen if we check) treat as 0
    if not (0 <= i < W and 0 <= j < H):
        return 0
    if (i & 1) and (j & 1):
        # cell between coords
        xi = (i-1)//2
        xj = (i+1)//2
        yi = (j-1)//2
        yj = (j+1)//2
        dx = xs[xj] - xs[xi]
        dy = ys[yj] - ys[yi]
        return dx * dy
    return 0

# find start cell containing (0,0)
sx = idx_x(0)
sy = idx_y(0)

# sx is index of coord >=0; if xs[sx] == 0:
# the cell immediately to its left is between sx-1 and sx
# choose the odd index representing that gap.
# We must be sure sx>0 and sy>0 because we padded with -INF_PAD.
start_i = 2*sx - 1
start_j = 2*sy - 1

# flood fill
stack = [(start_i, start_j)]
area = 0
escaped = False

while stack:
    i,j = stack.pop()
    if not (0 <= i < W and 0 <= j < H):
        # walked off allocated grid; treat as escape
        escaped = True
        continue
    idx = i + j*W
    if grid[idx] != OPEN:
        continue
    grid[idx] = BLOCKED  # mark visited

    # if we are in the outermost frame cell that touches ±INF_PAD coords,
    # we consider that escaped. Outer frame corresponds to cells adjacent to index 0 or last.
    if i <= 0 or j <= 0 or i >= W-1 or j >= H-1:
        escaped = True

    area += cell_area(i,j)

    # neighbors
    if i > 0:   # left
        if grid[idx-1] == OPEN: stack.append((i-1,j))
    if i+1 < W: # right
        if grid[idx+1] == OPEN: stack.append((i+1,j))
    if j > 0:   # up
        if grid[idx-W] == OPEN: stack.append((i,j-1))
    if j+1 < H: # down
        if grid[idx+W] == OPEN: stack.append((i,j+1))

print("INF" if escaped else area)
```

### Quick mental test

Suppose you have one horizontal wall from x=-1 to x=2 at y=1, and one vertical wall from y=0 to y=3 at x=1, and you start from (0,0). The code will compress `xs=[-1,0,1,2,-INF,+INF]` etc (after dedupe & sort). Start in correct cell, flood through any reachable cells, and if open to the ±INF\_PAD frame, print `INF`.

---

### If you *must* stay closer to the original style

If competition constraints require minimal changes, the minimal *bug patch list* is:

1. Fix indentation & loop nesting.
2. Add padding coordinates before sorting.
3. Fix `G` allocation to `[1]*(W*H)`.
4. Add bounds checks in `search`.
5. Fix start index; compute from `bl(sortx,0)` carefully (and use padded coords so `sx>0`).
6. Use `float('inf')` consistently or an `escaped` flag.
7. Correct boundary test in `get_score` to `<0` / `>= W` style.

---

**Let me know** if you’d like:

* A version instrumented with debug prints to watch the grid build.
* An ASCII visualization of the compressed grid.
* Sample input(s) to test bounded vs unbounded cases.

I’m happy to walk through a concrete example next.
