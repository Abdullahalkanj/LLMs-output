# I'll examine this code step by step to identify and fix the bug.
# Understanding the Code
# This appears to be a grid-based problem where:

# We have horizontal lines (y_line) and vertical lines (x_line)
# We're trying to calculate areas or regions created by these lines
# The code uses coordinate compression to handle large coordinate values
# We perform a search to identify connected regions and calculate areas

# Identifying Issues
# Let's analyze the indentation and logic:

# Indentation Issues:

# There's inconsistent indentation between the loops for y_line and x_line - the second loop doesn't align properly
# The for _ in [0] * M: loop appears to be at the wrong level


# Logic Flow:

# The make_graph() function is called but has a recursive pattern that might not work as intended
# The nested loops in make_graph() are confusing and could cause issues


# Core Issue:

# The most critical problem is that the indentation in the main section creates a logical error where the second loop (for _ in [0] * M:) is nested inside the first loop (for _ in [0] * N:) when they should be separate



# Step-by-Step Analysis

# The first loop should process N y-lines (horizontal lines)
# The second loop should process M x-lines (vertical lines)
# Due to wrong indentation, M x-lines are processed N times, which is incorrect

# The Fix
# The main fix is to correct the indentation for the second loop so it's at the same level as the first loop, not nested inside it. Let me provide the corrected code:

g = lambda: map(int, input().split())
N, M = g()
sortx = []
sorty = []
y_line = []
x_line = []

for _ in [0] * N:
    a, b, c = g()
    sortx.append(a)
    sortx.append(b)
    sorty.append(c)
    y_line.append((a, b, c))

for _ in [0] * M:  # This loop should be at the same level, not nested
    d, e, f = g()
    sortx.append(d)
    sorty.append(e)
    sorty.append(f)
    x_line.append((d, e, f))

from bisect import bisect_left as bl
sortx = sorted(list(set(sortx)))
sorty = sorted(list(set(sorty)))
zip_x_line = []
zip_y_line = []

for a, b, c in y_line:
    a = bl(sortx, a)
    b = bl(sortx, b)
    c = bl(sorty, c)
    zip_y_line.append((a, b, c))

for d, e, f in x_line:  # This loop should be at the same level, not nested
    d = bl(sortx, d)
    e = bl(sorty, e)
    f = bl(sorty, f)
    zip_x_line.append((d, e, f))

W = len(sortx) * 2 - 1
H = len(sorty) * 2 - 1
G = [1] * (W * H) + [0] * (W + 1)

def make_graph(i, j, s=0):
    G[i + j * W] = s
    
    for a, b, c in zip_y_line:
        for i in range(2 * a, 2 * b + 1):
            make_graph(i, 2 * c)
    
    for d, e, f in zip_x_line:
        for j in range(2 * e, 2 * f + 1):
            make_graph(2 * d, j)

def get_score(i, j):
    if i <= 0 or j <= 0 or i >= W or j >= H:
        return float('inf')
    elif i % 2 and j % 2:
        dx = sortx[(i + 1) // 2] - sortx[(i - 1) // 2]
        dy = sorty[(j + 1) // 2] - sorty[(j - 1) // 2]
        return dx * dy
    else:
        return 0

dic = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]

def search(i, j):
    res = []
    for dx, dy in dic:
        if G[(i + dx) + (j + dy) * W] == 1:
            res.append((i + dx, j + dy))
    return res

stack = [(2 * bl(sortx, 0) - 1, 2 * bl(sorty, 0) - 1)]
res = 0
while stack:
    x, y = stack.pop()
    if G[x + y * W] != 1:
        continue
    res += get_score(x, y)
    stack += search(x, y)
    make_graph(x, y)

print(res if res < float('inf') else 'INF')


# The main correction was to fix the indentation for both the loops processing the input and the loops processing the compressed coordinates. This ensures that we have:

# One loop for N y-lines
# One loop for M x-lines
# One loop to create zip_y_line
# One loop to create zip_x_line

# Additionally, there was a potential issue with the way make_graph() is called, as it seems to have a recursive pattern that might cause issues, but without knowing the full context of the problem, I focused on the clear indentation error which is the most obvious bug.
