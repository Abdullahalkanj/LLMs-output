# Let‚Äôs walk through what this code is trying to do, why it doesn‚Äôt work as written, and then I‚Äôll show you a clean, corrected version.

# 1) What the algorithm should be
# Split your input list lst into two sublists, one containing the elements at the odd positions (1st, 3rd, 5th, ‚Ä¶) and one containing the elements at the even positions (2nd, 4th, 6th, ‚Ä¶).

# Count how many times each value appears in each sublist.

# Pick for each sublist the most frequent value (call its count c1) and the second most frequent (call its count c2).

# If the two most‚Äêfrequent values are different, we can keep all those and only repaint the rest:

# changes
# =
# ùëõ
# ‚àí
# (
# ùëê
# 1
# odd
# +
# ùëê
# 1
# even
# )
# changes=n‚àí(c1 
# odd
# ‚Äã
#  +c1 
# even
# ‚Äã
#  )
# If they‚Äôre the same value X, we can‚Äôt use X on both sides (that would create adjacent equals).
# We instead choose whichever alternative costs fewer repaints:

# min
# ‚Å°
# (
# ùëõ
# ‚àí
# (
# ùëê
# 1
# odd
# +
# ùëê
# 2
# even
# )
# ,
# ‚ÄÖ‚Ää
# ùëõ
# ‚àí
# (
# ùëê
# 2
# odd
# +
# ùëê
# 1
# even
# )
# )
# .
# min(n‚àí(c1 
# odd
# ‚Äã
#  +c2 
# even
# ‚Äã
#  ),n‚àí(c2 
# odd
# ‚Äã
#  +c1 
# even
# ‚Äã
#  )).
# 2) What‚Äôs wrong in the given code
# Indentation errors

# The line b = not b is under the else: only, so b never flips on the first branch and you end up dumping everything into lst1.

# The calls to lst1.sort() and lst2.sort() are indented inside the for loop, so you‚Äôre re-sorting at every iteration (and potentially before lst2 even gets built).

# The big blocks of if/elif/else for counting frequencies are mis-aligned, so Python will either raise a SyntaxError or bind your elif to the wrong if.

# Logic bugs in counting

# You‚Äôre tracking counts in the nested lists c1 = [[" ",0], 0] in a very confusing way:

# c1[0][0] is meant to be the most frequent element,

# c1[0][1] its count,

# c1[1] the second most count.

# But your updates mix up which branch writes to [0][1] vs. [1], and you never reset your ‚Äúlast seen‚Äù value correctly at the end of each run.

# Duplication

# You do exactly the same frequency‚Äêfinding code twice, once for lst1 and once for lst2. That‚Äôs a maintenance headache.

# 3) A clean, corrected solution

from collections import Counter

def main(n: int, lst: list[str]) -> int:
    # 1) split into two parity‚Äêbased sublists
    odd_elems  = lst[0::2]   # positions 1,3,5,...
    even_elems = lst[1::2]   # positions 2,4,6,...

    # 2) count frequencies
    cnt_odd  = Counter(odd_elems)
    cnt_even = Counter(even_elems)

    # 3) find the top two (value, count) pairs, pad with (None,0) if needed
    top2_odd  = cnt_odd.most_common(2)  + [(None, 0)]
    top2_even = cnt_even.most_common(2) + [(None, 0)]
    (v1o, c1o), (v2o, c2o) = top2_odd[:2]
    (v1e, c1e), (v2e, c2e) = top2_even[:2]

    # 4) if the two ‚Äúbest‚Äù values differ, done in one shot
    if v1o != v1e:
        return n - (c1o + c1e)

    # 5) otherwise, we must choose one side‚Äôs runner-up
    #    and pay the repaint cost accordingly
    keep_with_odd_best = c1o + c2e
    keep_with_even_best = c2o + c1e
    return n - max(keep_with_odd_best, keep_with_even_best)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    n   = int(input())
    lst = input().split()
    print(main(n, lst))

# Why this works:
# We use Python‚Äôs Counter to avoid all the manual sorting and ‚Äúlast seen‚Äù gymnastics.

# most_common(2) gives us exactly the top‚Äêtwo counts; if there‚Äôs only one distinct value we pad with (None,0).

# We then directly implement the two cases:

# Different most‚Äêcommon values ‚Üí keep both.

# Same most‚Äêcommon value ‚Üí pick the better of the two ‚Äúcrossed‚Äù options.

# This both fixes the indentation and all the logic errors, and is far more readable and maintainable.
