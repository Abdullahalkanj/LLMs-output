[test1 buggy code]

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your function has three big problems:

1. **Broken indentation**
   Most of the `if`/`else` blocks aren’t indented under the loops or each other the way you intended, so large chunks of code never execute in the right place.  For example:

   ```python
   for e in lst:
   if b:
       lst1.append(e)
           else:
       lst2.append(e)
           b = not b
       lst1.sort()
   ```

   Here none of those lines are actually inside the `for`-loop (because the `if` is at the same indent as the `for`), and your `lst1.sort()` even ends up running only once, after the whole loop, but accidentally still indented under the `if`.

2. **Misplaced sorts and toggle**
   You probably meant to sort **after** you’ve built the two lists, and flip `b` once per element––but your code is toggling `b` only inside the `else`, and calling `.sort()` inside the loop, which will reorder your partial lists on every iteration.

3. **Overly-complicated “top two” logic**
   You roll your own nested lists `c1 = [[value, count], second_count]` with a giant copy-paste for `lst1` and `lst2`.  That not only makes the indentation nightmare worse, but it obscures the real intent: “find the two most-frequent elements in each list.”

---

### A clean, working rewrite

Below is one way to fix it.  The strategy is:

1. Split `lst` into the two alternating sublists.
2. Use `collections.Counter` to get frequency maps.
3. Extract the top two most common elements for each sublist (handling ties).
4. Compute the answer in clear steps.

```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

def main(n: int, lst: List[str]) -> int:
    # 1) Split into two lists:
    lst1 = lst[0::2]  # elements at even indices (0,2,4,…)
    lst2 = lst[1::2]  # elements at odd indices  (1,3,5,…)

    # 2) Count frequencies:
    cnt1 = Counter(lst1)
    cnt2 = Counter(lst2)

    # 3) Find the two most common for each list:
    #    .most_common() returns [(elem, freq), …], sorted by freq desc.
    top1 = cnt1.most_common(2) + [(None, 0)]  # pad so that index 1 always exists
    top2 = cnt2.most_common(2) + [(None, 0)]

    # Unpack
    (v1a, f1a), (v1b, f1b) = top1[0], top1[1]
    (v2a, f2a), (v2b, f2b) = top2[0], top2[1]

    # 4) If their most-common elements differ, we can keep both:
    if v1a != v2a:
        return n - (f1a + f2a)

    # 5) Otherwise, choose the best alternative:
    #    Option A: keep lst1’s 1st and lst2’s 2nd
    #    Option B: keep lst1’s 2nd and lst2’s 1st
    keep_a = f1a + f2b
    keep_b = f1b + f2a
    keep_best = max(keep_a, keep_b)

    return n - keep_best


if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(input())
    lst = input().split()
    print(main(n, lst))
```

#### Why this fixes the original issues

* **Indentation is unambiguous**: every block is clearly nested.
* **Sorting is gone**—we rely on `Counter` instead of sorting by value.
* **The toggle `b` disappears**, because slicing `lst[0::2]` and `lst[1::2]` is simpler and less error-prone.
* **Top-two logic** is handled by `most_common(2)`, which is battle-tested and readable.

With this rewrite your code will not only work as expected, but be much easier to maintain and understand.
