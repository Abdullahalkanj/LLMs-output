Here’s a clean, fully corrected version of your function.  I’ve replaced the messy manual counting and branching with Python’s `collections.Counter`, fixed the alternating‐split logic, corrected the “tie on top” case, and cleaned up indentation.  Below each change I’ve explained what was wrong and how it’s fixed.

```python
from collections import Counter

def main(n: int, lst: list) -> int:
    # Split into two lists: elements at even and odd positions
    lst1 = lst[::2]  # Fix: original loop+flag was over-complicated and mis-indented; slicing is clearer and bug-free.
    lst2 = lst[1::2] # Fix: same for odd positions.

    # Count frequencies in each half
    c1 = Counter(lst1)  # Fix: replaced manual sorting+count logic with Counter for correctness and simplicity.
    c2 = Counter(lst2)

    # Extract top two (element, count) in each; default to (None, 0) if missing
    common1 = c1.most_common(2) + [(None, 0)]*2
    top1_elem, top1_cnt = common1[0]      # Fix: handles empty or single-item lists safely.
    second1_cnt = common1[1][1]           # Fix: avoids index errors when there’s only one distinct element.

    common2 = c2.most_common(2) + [(None, 0)]*2
    top2_elem, top2_cnt = common2[0]
    second2_cnt = common2[1][1]

    # If the most common elements differ, we can keep them both
    if top1_elem != top2_elem:
        return n - top1_cnt - top2_cnt  # Fix: original “else” block had wrong subtraction in some branches.

    # If they’re the same, choose the better of:
    #  • keep top of lst1 + second of lst2, or
    #  • keep second of lst1 + top of lst2
    keep_option1 = top1_cnt + second2_cnt
    keep_option2 = second1_cnt + top2_cnt
    return n - max(keep_option1, keep_option2)  # Fix: original tie-breaking logic was tangled and had misplaced branches.

# Read input and invoke
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(input())
    lst = input().split()
    print(main(n, lst))
```

**Summary of fixes**

1. **Alternation logic**

   * Removed the manual `b` flag and loop; used `lst[::2]` and `lst[1::2]` slicing to split even/odd positions correctly and succinctly.
2. **Frequency counting**

   * Eliminated the dozens of nested `if`/`else` blocks that attempted to track modes and runner-ups; replaced with `Counter.most_common()`.
3. **Edge‐case safety**

   * Appended dummy `(None,0)` entries so even if there’s only one distinct element, `common[1]` won’t IndexError.
4. **Tie‐breaking & return logic**

   * Clarified the three cases (“top elems differ” vs. “same top elem”) and made the subtraction logic correct in every branch.
