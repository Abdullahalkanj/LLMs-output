“This code doesn’t work as expected. What’s wrong with it, and how would you fix it?”
[buggy code]

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your code actually has two separate problems:

1. **Indentation / Syntax Errors**
   Almost every method in your `UnionFind` class (and the free‐standing functions afterwards) is mis-indented, so Python will throw `IndentationError` before it even gets to running your “zero‐counting” logic.  For example:

   ```python
   class UnionFind():
   def __init__(self, n):
       self.n = n
       self.parents = [-1] * n
       def find(self, x):
           …
   ```

   Here, `def __init__` should be indented one level under `class UnionFind:`, and `def find` should be at the *same* level as `__init__`, not nested inside it.  Likewise, your definition of `dijkstra_heap` is indented under the class but doesn’t take a `self` argument, so it’ll never parse correctly.

2. **Logic in the factorial “zero‐count” at the bottom**
   Your intent seems to be to compute the number of trailing zeros of $n!$ by counting the factors of 2 and 5:

   ```python
   while 2**d1 * 2 <= n:
       ans1 += n // (2**d1 * 2)
       d1 += 1
   ```

   But that extra `* 2` inside both the `while` condition and the divisor means you’re actually summing

   $$
     \sum_{d_1\ge1} \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2^{d_1+1}} \right\rfloor
   $$

   instead of the correct

   $$
     \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2^i} \right\rfloor.
   $$

   The same mistake is repeated for powers of 5.

### How to fix it

1. **Correct the indentation** so that all your class methods line up properly.  For example:

   ```python
   class UnionFind:
       def __init__(self, n):
           self.n = n
           self.parents = [-1] * n

       def find(self, x):
           if self.parents[x] < 0:
               return x
           self.parents[x] = self.find(self.parents[x])
           return self.parents[x]

       def union(self, x, y):
           x = self.find(x)
           y = self.find(y)
           if x == y:
               return
           if self.parents[x] > self.parents[y]:
               x, y = y, x
           self.parents[x] += self.parents[y]
           self.parents[y] = x

       # …and so on for size, same, members, etc.
   ```

2. **Rewrite the trailing‐zero logic** without that extra `* 2`.  A clean way is:

   ```python
   n = int(input())
   def count_factors(n, p):
       """Count how many times prime p divides n!"""
       cnt = 0
       while n:
           n //= p
           cnt += n
       return cnt

   twos = count_factors(n, 2)
   fives = count_factors(n, 5)
   print(min(twos, fives))
   ```

   Or, if you really want the `while` + exponent pattern:

   ```python
   n = int(input())
   ans2 = 0
   power = 5
   while power <= n:
       ans2 += n // power
       power *= 5

   ans1 = 0
   power = 2
   while power <= n:
       ans1 += n // power
       power *= 2

   print(min(ans1, ans2))
   ```

With those two changes—fixing your indentation so Python can actually parse the file, and removing the extra `* 2` so that you’re really summing $\lfloor n/2^i\rfloor$ and $\lfloor n/5^i\rfloor$—your script will both run *and* correctly compute the number of trailing zeros in $n!$.
