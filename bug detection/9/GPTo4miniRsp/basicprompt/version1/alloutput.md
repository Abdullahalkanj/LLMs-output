[buggy code]

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The mistake is in the two `while`-loops that compute the exponents of 2 and 5 in $n!$.  By writing

```python
while 2**d1 * 2 <= n:
    ans1 += n // (2**d1 * 2)
    d1 += 1
```

you are actually summing

$$
\biggl\lfloor\frac{n}{2^{d_1+1}}\biggr\rfloor
$$

for $d_1=1,2,\dots$, which skips the term $\lfloor n/2\rfloor$.  The same problem happens for your 5-loop (you’re dividing by $5^{d_2}\times2$ instead of just $5^{d_2}$, so you skip the $\lfloor n/5\rfloor$ term).

What you really want is the standard formula

$$
\sum_{i=1}^\infty \Bigl\lfloor\frac{n}{p^i}\Bigr\rfloor
$$

stopping once $p^i>n$.  Here’s the minimal fix in your main code:

```python
n = int(input())
ans1 = 0
ans2 = 0

d1 = 1
# count how many factors of 2 are in n!
while 2**d1 <= n:
    ans1 += n // (2**d1)
    d1 += 1

d2 = 1
# count how many factors of 5 are in n!
while 5**d2 <= n:
    ans2 += n // (5**d2)
    d2 += 1

# number of trailing zeros is min(exponent_of_2, exponent_of_5)
ans = min(ans1, ans2)
print(ans)
```

Or, since in a factorial the exponent of 2 is always ≥ the exponent of 5, you can simplify to just the 5-loop:

```python
n = int(input())
ans = 0
i = 5
while i <= n:
    ans += n // i
    i *= 5
print(ans)
```

Either of these will correctly compute the number of trailing zeros of $n!$.
