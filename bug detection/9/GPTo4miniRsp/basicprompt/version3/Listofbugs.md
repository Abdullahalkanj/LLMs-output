## **List of bugs**

---

**B1 – Incorrect logic and placement of trailing zero count calculation**
**Description:** The logic for computing the number of trailing zeros is placed in the global scope without encapsulation and is incorrect. It also fails to handle odd inputs properly. The corrected version wraps this logic in a function (`func(n)`) and adds an early return for odd inputs.
**Buggy Code Line / Issue:**

```python
n = int(input())  
ans1 = 0  
ans2 = 0  
d1 = 1  
d2 = 1  
while 2 ** d1 * 2 <= n:  
    ans1 += n // (2 ** d1 * 2)  
    d1 += 1  
...  
print(ans)
```

– No function wrapper, incorrect loop condition, and no `n % 2 == 1` check.
**Detected by Test(s):** ALL

**B2 – Incorrect loop condition for powers of 2 in trailing zero computation**
**Description:** The loop condition `2 ** d1 * 2 <= n` misses correct powers of 2 for trailing zero calculation. The fixed version uses `2 ** d1 <= n`, which correctly captures the powers contributing to factor 2.
**Buggy Code Line / Issue:**

```python
while 2 ** d1 * 2 <= n:  
    ans1 += n // (2 ** d1 * 2)
```

**Detected by Test(s):** ALL

**B3 – Extra multiplication in denominator of loop for powers of 5**
**Description:** The buggy version incorrectly multiplies `5 ** d2 * 2`, reducing the count of 5s, whereas the correct formula is `n // (5 ** d2 * 2)` only if justified. The fixed version retains this expression, so this may be part of intentional logic — but should be cross-checked based on context.
**Buggy Code Line / Issue:**

```python
while 5 ** d2 * 2 <= n:  
    ans2 += n // (5 ** d2 * 2)
```

**Detected by Test(s):** ALL

**B4 – Missing encapsulation of second trailing zero function (func2)**
**Description:** The buggy code does not include the `func2(n)` function, which calculates trailing zeros by computing the full factorial. While this function is not called, its absence may cause test failure if expected.
**Buggy Code Line / Issue:**
Missing entirely in buggy version:

```python
def func2(n):  
    if n % 2 == 1:  
        return 0  
    x = 1  
    for i in range(2, n + 2, 2):  
        x *= i  
    ...
```

**Detected by Test(s):** ALL

**B5 – Global logic executes before function guard/checks**
**Description:** Because all the main logic is globally executed in the buggy version, it’s not reusable or testable. The fixed version uses `func(n)` to encapsulate this logic, improving testability and correctness.
**Buggy Code Line / Issue:**

```python
# All logic runs globally after input()
```

**Detected by Test(s):** ALL
