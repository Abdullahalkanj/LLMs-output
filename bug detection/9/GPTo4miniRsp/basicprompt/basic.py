# The problem turned out to be nothing mystical in UnionFind or any of your helper routines – it was just bad indentation at the very bottom. As written, your second while and your ans = … line are sitting inside your first while, so:

# You only ever compute ans2 while you’re still in the 2-loop.

# You re-compute ans on every iteration of the 2-loop.

# If the 2-loop doesn’t run even once (e.g. very small n), you never run the 5-loop at all.

# What you meant was “run both loops, then take the min.” The fix is simply to de-indent the 5-loop and the final ans = … so they sit at the same level as the first while.

# Here’s the corrected bottom part:

n = int(input())
ans1 = 0
ans2 = 0
d1 = 1
d2 = 1

# count powers of 2 in n!!  (i.e. floor(n/4)+floor(n/8)+…)
while 2**d1 * 2 <= n:
    ans1 += n // (2**d1 * 2)
    d1 += 1

# count powers of 5 in n!!  (i.e. floor(n/10)+floor(n/50)+…)
while 5**d2 * 2 <= n:
    ans2 += n // (5**d2 * 2)
    d2 += 1

# trailing zeros = min(exponent of 2, exponent of 5)
ans = min(ans1, ans2)
print(ans)

# Make sure that both while loops and the final ans = … are at the same indentation level (no mixing of tabs/spaces), and you’ll get the right answer every time.

# Here’s the minimal change to the bottom of your script so that both loops run independently and you compute the final answer only once. Replace everything from n = int(input()) onward with:

n = int(input())
ans1 = 0
ans2 = 0
d1 = 1
d2 = 1

# count factors of 2 in n!!  (i.e. floor(n/4) + floor(n/8) + …)
while 2**d1 * 2 <= n:
    ans1 += n // (2**d1 * 2)
    d1 += 1

# count factors of 5 in n!!  (i.e. floor(n/10) + floor(n/50) + …)
while 5**d2 * 2 <= n:
    ans2 += n // (5**d2 * 2)
    d2 += 1

# trailing zeros in n!! is min(exponent of 2, exponent of 5)
ans = min(ans1, ans2)
print(ans)

# Make sure those two while-loops and the final ans = … / print are all at the same indentation level (no extra spaces or tabs in front). That fixes the bug.
