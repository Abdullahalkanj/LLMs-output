[buggy code]

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here’s a cleaned‐up, properly indented and working version. I’ve

1. Pulled all of the input‐loops out to the top level (so you read **M** edges, then **N** recharge rules);
2. Capped your initial **S** at `A_m * N` only once;
3. Dropped the strange “j-loop” early-exit logic (it wasn’t needed for Dijkstra);
4. Made the `Cost` entries tuples instead of 3-deep lists;
5. Added the usual “skip stale heap entries” guard;
6. Kept track of the best answer to each node in `Ans[]`, while you explore all (cost,hold,node) states with `used[][]`.

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(N, start, S, Cost, Change, A_m):
    INF = 10**18
    max_hold = A_m * N
    # Ans[u] = best time to reach u (over any hold)
    Ans = [INF] * N
    Ans[start] = 0
    # used[u][h] = best time to reach (u, h)
    used = [[INF] * (max_hold + 1) for _ in range(N)]
    used[start][S] = 0

    heap = [(0, S, start)]  # (time_so_far, hold, node)
    while heap:
        time_so_far, hold, u = heapq.heappop(heap)
        # stale entry?
        if time_so_far > used[u][hold]:
            continue

        # 1) Try every outgoing edge u→v
        for v in range(N):
            a, b = Cost[u][v]
            if a >= 0 and hold >= a:
                new_hold = hold - a
                new_time = time_so_far + b
                if new_time < used[v][new_hold]:
                    used[v][new_hold] = new_time
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (new_time, new_hold, v))
                    # update best answer for v
                    if new_time < Ans[v]:
                        Ans[v] = new_time

        # 2) Try recharging at u
        add_hold, add_time = Change[u]
        new_hold = min(hold + add_hold, max_hold)
        new_time = time_so_far + add_time
        if new_time < used[u][new_hold]:
            used[u][new_hold] = new_time
            heapq.heappush(heap, (new_time, new_hold, u))

    return Ans


def main():
    N, M, S = map(int, input().split())

    # cost[u][v] = (a, b), or (-1,-1) if no edge
    Cost = [[(-1, -1) for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]
    Change = [None] * N

    A_m = 0
    for _ in range(M):
        u, v, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        u -= 1; v -= 1
        A_m = max(A_m, a)
        Cost[u][v] = (a, b)
        Cost[v][u] = (a, b)

    for i in range(N):
        c, d = map(int, input().split())
        Change[i] = (c, d)

    # You never need more than A_m * N holds
    S = min(S, A_m * N)

    T = dijkstra(N, 0, S, Cost, Change, A_m)
    # print answers for nodes 2…N
    for dist in T[1:]:
        print(dist)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

**What changed and why?**

* **Indentation & Loop‐scoping**: Your original “for i in range(N)” for reading recharge costs was accidentally *inside* the edge‐reading loop, and your `dijkstra` def was inside that too. Now everything is at the correct top‐level.
* **Data structures**: Switched `Cost[u][v]` to a simple tuple `(a,b)` so you don’t have to worry about list‐of‐lists‐of‐lists.
* **Dijkstra logic**:

  * We push and pop `(time, hold, node)` states.
  * **Skip** any heap entry whose `time` is worse than `used[node][hold]` (the classic “lazy-deletion” guard).
  * For each edge, if you have enough “hold” to pay the `a`‐cost, you move to `v` with `hold−a` and pay `b` time.
  * Then you also always consider “recharging” at your current node.
  * We update `Ans[v]` whenever we find a better time to reach `v`, so at the end `Ans[i]` is the minimum time to get to node `i`.

This should now run in $O((N\cdot A_mN)\log(N\cdot A_mN))$ and correctly print the minimum times to all nodes from node 1.
