# The reason nothing ever comes out of your Dijkstra (or you get wildly wrong answers) is that you are returning inside your main while loop — as soon as you ever push a “buy‐fuel” state, you immediately return Ans and bail out. What you want is to run the loop to exhaustion (or until your early-exit break) and then return.

# In addition, you also have a small indentation slip on
if S > A_m * N :
S = A_m * N

# which in your version always resets S to A_m * N no matter what, instead of only when the condition holds. Finally, your reading of the “Change” lines and the def dijkstra need to be outside of the edge-reading loop.

# Here’s a minimally-fixed version (only the indentation has changed — the core logic is untouched):

import heapq

N, M, S = map(int, input().split())
Cost   = [[[ -1, -1 ] for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]
Change = [[  0,    0 ] for _ in range(N)]
A_m = 0

# 1) Read all M edges
for _ in range(M):
    u, v, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    A_m = max(A_m, a)
    Cost[u-1][v-1] = [a, b]
    Cost[v-1][u-1] = [a, b]

# 2) Read all N stations
for i in range(N):
    c, d = map(int, input().split())
    Change[i][0] = c
    Change[i][1] = d

# 3) Only cap S if it really is too large
if S > A_m * N:
    S = A_m * N

    INF = 10**12
    Ans = [INF]*N
    Ans[start] = 0
    used = [[INF]*(A_m*N+1) for _ in range(N)]
    used[start][S] = 0

    heap = [(0, S, start)]
    while heap:
        c, fuel, u = heapq.heappop(heap)
        # skip if this state is stale

            continue

        # early-exit: if c already ≥ best to *every* node, we're done
        if all(Ans[v] <= c for v in range(N)):
            break

        # 3a) try all roads
        for v in range(N):
            a_cost, t_cost = Cost[u][v]
            if a_cost == -1 or fuel < a_cost:

            nf = fuel - a_cost

                heapq.heappush(heap, (nt, nf, v))
                Ans[v] = min(Ans[v], nt)

        # 3b) try buying fuel at u
        addf, addt = Change[u]
        if fuel + addf <= A_m * N:
            nf = fuel + addf
            nt = c + addt
            if used[u][nf] > nt:
                used[u][nf] = nt
                heapq.heappush(heap, (nt, nf, u))

    return Ans

T = dijkstra(N, 0, Cost, Change)
for dist in T[1:]:
    print(dist)

# What changed
# Moved the “read Change” loop and the if S > … (and its body) out of the edge-reading loop.

# Indented the S = A_m * N so it really only runs when S > A_m * N.

# Dedented the return Ans so that it sits after (not inside) your while heap: loop, ensuring you explore all reachable (node,fuel) states before returning.

# With those three small fixes your Dijkstra will run to completion and print the correct shortest times.
