[buggy code]

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**1. What the code is supposed to do overall**
This is a “2-D” Dijkstra: you have a graph of $N$ nodes and $M$ undirected edges.  Each edge $(u,v)$ has two weights:

* **$a$**: the amount of **resource** it costs you to traverse
* **$b$**: the amount of **time** it costs you to traverse

At each node $i$, you can also **recharge** your resource by $c_i$ units at the cost of $d_i$ time.  You start at node 0 with $S$ resource, and you want the minimum time to reach every other node, never letting your resource drop below 0 or exceed its maximum possible $A_{\max}\times N$ (where $A_{\max}$ is the largest $a$ over all edges).

---

**2. Step-by-step through the (intended) logic**

1. **Read input**

   * $N,M,S$
   * For each of the $M$ edges: read $(u,v,a,b)$, track the global maximum edge‐cost $A_{\max}=\max a$, and store both $a$ and $b$ in a 2-D array `Cost[u][v]` and `Cost[v][u]`.
   * For each node $i$, read its recharge parameters $(c_i,d_i)$ into `Change[i]`.
2. **Cap** your starting resource $S$ to at most $A_{\max}\times N$.
3. **Run a modified Dijkstra** over states $(\text{node},\text{resource\_left})$, with a min-heap keyed by **time so far**.

   * **Travel transition** $(u\to v)$: if you have ≥ $a_{uv}$ resource, you can go to $(v, \text{resource}-a_{uv})$ at **time+ $b_{uv}$**.
   * **Recharge transition** at node $u$: go to $(u, \min(\text{resource}+c_u, A_{\max}\!N))$ at **time+ $d_u$**.
4. **Keep** an array `used[node][res]` = best time found so far for that state, to prune worse visits.  Also maintain `Ans[node]` = best time seen so far (over all resource levels) for reaching `node`.
5. When heap is empty (or all `Ans` are already ≤ current time), finish and print the answers for nodes 1…$N-1$.

---

**3. Where the original logic breaks**

* **Indentation everywhere**: the `for` loops, the `if S>…` and especially the big `dijkstra` definition are all mis-indented, so Python will either throw `IndentationError` or bind things wrongly.
* **Reusing the loop variable `i`** for both edges (over $M$) and node changes (over $N$) clobbers your indexing.
* **Reading `Change` inside the edge-loop** instead of after leads to the wrong number of inputs read.
* **Defining `dijkstra` inside the `if S>…` block** (because of indentation) makes it conditional and never callable.
* **Early `return Ans` inside the `while`** (wrong indent) makes the loop exit on the first iteration.
* The “all-done” check using `j` is botched by mis-indentation, so it never actually breaks at the right time.
* **You never `continue`** when popping a stale state (i.e.\ `time > used[node][hold]`), so you’ll re-process worse states.

---

**4. Why these are problems**

* **Syntax/runtime errors**: bad indentation means the script won’t even parse, or will bind loops and blocks wrongly.
* **Wrong input parsing**: mixing the edge loop with the node-recharge loop reads the wrong number of lines and assigns them to the wrong variables.
* **Logic never executes**: the `dijkstra` function may never be defined or may return immediately, so you don’t explore the graph properly.
* **Exponential blow-up**: without pruning stale heap entries, you get far too many states.
* **Incorrect results**: even if it ran, you’d almost certainly print garbage.

**5. Corrected version**

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(N, S, Cost, Change, A_m):
    INF = 10**18
    max_hold = A_m * N
    # Ans[i] = best time to reach node i (over all resource levels)
    Ans = [INF] * N
    Ans[0] = 0

    # used[u][r] = best time to reach (u, r)
    used = [[INF] * (max_hold + 1) for _ in range(N)]
    used[0][S] = 0

    # heap entries are (time_so_far, resource_left, node)
    heap = [(0, S, 0)]

    while heap:
        time, hold, u = heapq.heappop(heap)
        # stale state?
        if time > used[u][hold]:
            continue

        # optional early exit if all Ans[] ≤ time
        if all(Ans[v] <= time for v in range(N)):
            break

        # 1) travel along edges
        for v in range(N):
            a, b = Cost[u][v]
            if a >= 0 and hold >= a:
                nt = time + b
                nr = hold - a
                if used[v][nr] > nt:
                    used[v][nr] = nt
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (nt, nr, v))
                    if Ans[v] > nt:
                        Ans[v] = nt

        # 2) recharge at u
        c, d = Change[u]
        nr = min(max_hold, hold + c)
        nt = time + d
        if used[u][nr] > nt:
            used[u][nr] = nt
            heapq.heappush(heap, (nt, nr, u))

    return Ans

def main():
    N, M, S = map(int, input().split())
    Cost = [[[-1, -1] for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]
    Change = [[0, 0] for _ in range(N)]

    A_m = 0
    # 1) read edges
    for _ in range(M):
        u, v, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        u -= 1; v -= 1
        A_m = max(A_m, a)
        Cost[u][v] = [a, b]
        Cost[v][u] = [a, b]

    # 2) read recharge info
    for i in range(N):
        c, d = map(int, input().split())
        Change[i] = [c, d]

    # 3) cap initial resource
    S = min(S, A_m * N)

    # 4) run Dijkstra and print
    Ans = dijkstra(N, S, Cost, Change, A_m)
    for t in Ans[1:]:
        print(t)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**6. Explanation of each change**

| Change                                                                             | Reasoning                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Moved the `Change`-reading loop** out *of* the edge-loop                         | Otherwise you read $N$ pairs $(c,d)$ for *every* edge, clobbering inputs. |
| **Did not reuse `i`** for both loops (`for _ in range(M)` and `for i in range(N)`) | Prevents one loop from overwriting the other’s index.                     |
| **Fixed indentation** of all blocks (`for`, `if`, function defs)                   | So Python parses it correctly and executes in the intended order.         |
| **Separated `dijkstra` into its own top-level function**                           | It shouldn’t be defined inside an `if` or loop.                           |
| **Added a stale-state check** (`if time > used[u][hold]: continue`)                | Prevents re-processing inferior paths and keeps the heap manageable.      |
| **Implemented the “all-done” break** with a clean `if all(Ans[v] <= time …)`       | The original `j` flag was mis-indented and never worked.                  |
| **Capped the “recharge” transition** with `min(max_hold, hold + c)`                | Ensures resource never exceeds its global maximum.                        |
| **Uniform naming** (`u,v,a,b` and `c,d`) and 0-based indexing                      | Avoids off-by-one errors and keeps code clear.                            |
| **Placed `S = min(S, A_m*N)` after reading *all* edges**                           | We must know the true `A_m` before capping.                               |
| **Cleaned up heap entry structure** and result printing                            | So it’s obvious we return a list of times and print for nodes 1…$N-1$.    |

With these fixes, the code will correctly compute, in $O\bigl((N\cdot A_{\max}N)\log(N\cdot A_{\max}N)\bigr)$, the minimum travel time to each node under the resource constraints.
