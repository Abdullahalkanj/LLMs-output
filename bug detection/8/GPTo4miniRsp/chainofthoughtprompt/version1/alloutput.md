 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here’s a walkthrough of what your code is *trying* to do, where it goes off the rails, and a corrected version.

---

### 1. What the code is trying to achieve

You have a graph of $N$ cities and $M$ bidirectional roads.

* Each road $(u,v)$ has two costs:

  1. **fuel cost** $a$ (how much “fuel” you spend to travel),
  2. **time cost** $b$ (how long it takes).
* You start in city 1 (index 0) with $S$ units of fuel.
* At each city $i$, you can spend time $d_i$ to *gain* $c_i$ units of fuel (a “refill” operation).
* You want the minimum **time** to reach every other city, never letting your fuel drop below zero, and you can never store more than $\max a \times N$ fuel (the code caps $S$ at that).

This is a classic **resource-constrained shortest-path**: the state is $(\text{city},\;\text{fuel\_in\_tank})$, edge-weights are time, and fuel is consumed and replenished along the way. Dijkstra’s algorithm on the expanded state-graph finds the answer in $O(N\times (A_{\max}N)\log(NA_{\max}N))$.

---

### 2. Step-by-step through the code

```python
import heapq

N, M, S = map(int, input().split())
```

* Read number of cities `N`, roads `M`, and starting fuel `S`.

```python
Cost = [[[ -1, -1 ] for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]
Change = [[0]*2 for _ in range(N)]
A_m = 0
```

* `Cost[u][v] = [fuel_cost, time_cost]`, initialized to $[-1,-1]$.
* `Change[i] = [fuel_gain, time_cost]` at city $i$.
* `A_m` will track the largest single-road fuel cost $a$.

```python
for i in range(M):
    u, v, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    A_m = max(A_m, a)
    Cost[u-1][v-1][0] = a
    Cost[u-1][v-1][1] = b
    Cost[v-1][u-1][0] = a
    Cost[v-1][u-1][1] = b
    for i in range(N):
        c, d = map(int, input().split())
        Change[i][0] = c
        Change[i][1] = d
```

* **Bug #1 (indentation):** the refill-data loop is *inside* the roads loop. You end up reading the $N$ city refills *$M$ times*, and the last pass overwrites all `Change`.
* **Bug #2 (reusing `i`):** you shadow the outer loop’s `i` by reusing it in the inner loop.

```python
if S > A_m * N:
    S = A_m * N
```

* Cap your initial fuel at $A_{\max}\times N$.
* (Indentation in your paste is off, but presumably you meant this outside all loops.)

```python
def dijkstra(N, start, Cost, Change):
    Ans = [10**12]*N
    Ans[0] = 0
    minHeap = []
    used = [[10**12]*(A_m*N+1) for _ in range(N)]
    used[start][S] = 0
    heapq.heappush(minHeap, (0, S, start))
```

* `Ans[i]` will hold the best time found to reach city $i$.
* `used[v][f]` holds the best time to reach state `(v,fuel=f)`.
* Initialize at `start` city with `S` fuel and `0` time.

```python
    while minHeap:
        (c, hold, current) = heapq.heappop(minHeap)
        j = 1
        for i in range(N):
            if Ans[i] > c:
                j = 0
                break
        if j == 1:
            break
```

* This tries to “early‐exit” once every city’s best time is ≤ `c`.
* **Bug #3 (logic+indent):** you break out of the outer loop *as soon as* the *first* city has `Ans[i] ≤ c`. That’s not what you intended! Also your indentation in the paste is inconsistent.

```python
        # try each neighbor (road)  
        for road in range(N):
            if Cost[current][road][0] != -1:
                if hold >= Cost[current][road][0]:
                    nfuel = hold - Cost[current][road][0]
                    ntime = c + Cost[current][road][1]
                    if used[road][nfuel] > ntime:
                        used[road][nfuel] = ntime
                        heapq.heappush(minHeap, (ntime, nfuel, road))
                        if Ans[road] > ntime:
                            Ans[road] = ntime
```

* If you have enough fuel to go to `road`, consume it, pay the time, push new state; update `Ans[road]` if this is the best time for *any* fuel level.

```python
        # consider refilling at 'current'  
        gain, cost_time = Change[current]
        if hold + gain <= A_m * N:
            if used[current][hold + gain] > c + cost_time:
                # BUG #4: You forgot to update used[current][hold+gain] here
                heapq.heappush(minHeap, (c + cost_time, hold + gain, current))
    return Ans
```

* **Bug #4:** you never set `used[current][hold+gain] = c + cost_time`, so you may push infinitely many refill‐states.

```python
T = dijkstra(N, 0, Cost, Change)
for i in T[1:]:
    print(i)
```

* Run from city 0 and print times to cities 2..N.

### 3. Key problems & where things go wrong

1. **Input‐reading indentation**

   * You read the city‐refill data inside the roads loop, repeating it $M$ times and clobbering it.
2. **Variable shadowing**

   * Using `for i in range(...)` inside another `for i` loop confuses index meaning.
3. **Broken early-exit check**

   * The code’s attempt to stop Dijkstra once all `Ans[] ≤ c` is both logically flawed and mis-indented.
4. **Never updating `used` on refill**

   * You push a better refill state into the heap but never record it in `used`, so you may revisit it endlessly.
5. **`Ans[0] = 0` hard-coded**

   * You ignore the `start` parameter; if you ever wanted to start somewhere else, you’d be stuck.
6. **Indentation & style**

   * Mixed spaces, inconsistent blocks: hard to read and easy to introduce bugs.

### 4. A corrected, cleaned-up version

```python
import heapq

def read_input():
    N, M, S = map(int, input().split())
    # Read roads
    Cost = [[(-1, -1) for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]
    A_m = 0
    for _ in range(M):
        u, v, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        u -= 1; v -= 1
        A_m = max(A_m, a)
        Cost[u][v] = (a, b)
        Cost[v][u] = (a, b)
    # Read city refill info
    Change = []
    for _ in range(N):
        c, d = map(int, input().split())
        Change.append((c, d))
    # Cap initial fuel
    S = min(S, A_m * N)
    return N, M, S, A_m, Cost, Change

def dijkstra(N, start, S, A_m, Cost, Change):
    INF = 10**18
    # Best time to reach city i (over all fuel levels)
    best_time = [INF] * N
    best_time[start] = 0

    # best_state[v][f] = best time to reach (v,f)
    max_fuel = A_m * N
    best_state = [ [INF] * (max_fuel + 1) for _ in range(N) ]
    best_state[start][S] = 0

    heap = [(0, start, S)]  # (time, city, fuel)
    while heap:
        time, city, fuel = heapq.heappop(heap)
        # If this state is stale, skip
        if time > best_state[city][fuel]:
            continue

        # Explore roads
        for nei in range(N):
            a, b = Cost[city][nei]
            if a >= 0 and fuel >= a:
                new_fuel = fuel - a
                new_time = time + b
                if new_time < best_state[nei][new_fuel]:
                    best_state[nei][new_fuel] = new_time
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (new_time, nei, new_fuel))
                    best_time[nei] = min(best_time[nei], new_time)

        # Explore refill
        gain, t_cost = Change[city]
        new_fuel = min(fuel + gain, max_fuel)
        new_time = time + t_cost
        if new_time < best_state[city][new_fuel]:
            best_state[city][new_fuel] = new_time
            heapq.heappush(heap, (new_time, city, new_fuel))

    return best_time

def main():
    N, M, S, A_m, Cost, Change = read_input()
    dist = dijkstra(N, 0, S, A_m, Cost, Change)
    # Print unreachable as -1 if you like, or INF
    for d in dist[1:]:
        print(d if d < 10**17 else -1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### What changed & why

* **Separated input** into two clear loops (roads, then city refills).
* **No variable shadowing**: I use `_` for unused loop counters.
* **Removed the broken “early-exit”**: it rarely helps and your logic was inverted anyway; Dijkstra’s priority queue already gives you correctness.
* **Always update `best_state` on refill** before pushing to the heap, so you won’t reconsider the same refill over and over.
* **`best_time[start] = 0`** honors the `start` variable cleanly.
* **Clamping fuel** on refill with `min(…)`, which is both safe and clear.

This version is O$(N \times A_m N)\log(N A_m N)$, it’s easier to read, and it fixes all four of your core bugs.
