[buggy code]

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Overview**
This program reads a graph of *N* nodes and *M* undirected edges. Each edge from *u* to *v* has two parameters:

* “resource cost” *a* (required to traverse),
* “time cost” *b* (added to the path length).

You also have an initial resource amount *S*, and at each node you can “buy” more resource: at node *i*, spending time *dᵢ* gives you *cᵢ* additional resource (up to a global maximum). The goal is to compute, for each node, the minimum total time to reach it from node 1, respecting resource constraints. The core is a modified Dijkstra’s algorithm over (node, remaining\_resource) states.

### Detected bugs

> *Throughout the following, “line X” refers to the corresponding line in the submitted snippet.*

1. **Indentation errors** (lines 7–18)

   * The input loop for the per-node “Change” data is nested inside the edge loop, due to mis-indentation (lines 13–16).
   * Similarly, the clamp of *S* (line 17–18) is inside that same loop.

2. **Variable shadowing** (lines 6, 13)

   * The loop over edges uses `for i in range(M):`, then inside reuses `for i in range(N):` to read `Change`. This overwrites the edge-loop index and is confusing.

3. **Wrong initialization of `Ans`** (line 21)

   ```python
   Ans[0] = 0
   ```

   This hard-codes the start at node 1; if you ever called `dijkstra` with a different `start`, it would still set node 0 to zero instead of `Ans[start]`.

4. **Broken termination check** (lines 28–34)

   ```python
       j = 1
       for i in range(N):
           if Ans[i] > c:
               j = 0
               break
           if j == 1:
               break
   ```

   * The inner `if j == 1` is indented under the `for`, so it never executes as intended.
   * The logic as written would either break immediately or not at all; it doesn’t actually detect “all finalized” correctly.

5. **Inefficient graph representation** (line 3)
   Using an *N×N* matrix with per-entry lists is both memory- and time-inefficient for sparse graphs. An adjacency list is better.

### Corrected version

```python
import heapq

# Read basic input
N, M, S = map(int, input().split())

# Build adjacency list: graph[u] = list of (v, resource_cost, time_cost)
graph = [[] for _ in range(N)]
A_max = 0
for _ in range(M):
    u, v, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    u -= 1; v -= 1
    graph[u].append((v, a, b))
    graph[v].append((u, a, b))
    A_max = max(A_max, a)

# Read per-node resource–time exchange data
# Change[i] = (resource_gain, time_cost)
Change = [None]*N
for i in range(N):
    c, d = map(int, input().split())
    Change[i] = (c, d)

# Clamp starting resource S to the theoretical maximum
max_hold = A_max * N
if S > max_hold:
    S = max_hold

def dijkstra(N, start, S, graph, Change):
    INF = 10**18
    # best_time[u] := best time found to reach u (over all resource states)
    best_time = [INF]*N
    best_time[start] = 0

    # used[u][r] := minimum time to reach (u, remaining_resource=r)
    used = [ [INF]*(max_hold+1) for _ in range(N) ]
    used[start][S] = 0

    heap = [(0, S, start)]  # (time_so_far, resource_remaining, node)

    while heap:
        time_so_far, res, u = heapq.heappop(heap)
        # If we've already found a better way to this state, skip
        if time_so_far > used[u][res]:
            continue

        # Record best time to reach u
        if time_so_far < best_time[u]:
            best_time[u] = time_so_far

        # Option 1: buy more resource at node u
        gain, cost_time = Change[u]
        new_res = min(max_hold, res + gain)
        new_time = time_so_far + cost_time
        if used[u][new_res] > new_time:
            used[u][new_res] = new_time
            heapq.heappush(heap, (new_time, new_res, u))

        # Option 2: traverse each outgoing edge
        for v, req_res, edge_time in graph[u]:
            if res >= req_res:
                nr = res - req_res
                nt = time_so_far + edge_time
                if used[v][nr] > nt:
                    used[v][nr] = nt
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (nt, nr, v))

    return best_time

# Run from node 0 (which represents input node 1)
T = dijkstra(N, start=0, S=S, graph=graph, Change=Change)
# Output answers for nodes 2..N
for t in T[1:]:
    print(t)
```

**Key fixes and comments:**

* **Adjacency list** instead of an *N×N* matrix for efficiency.
* Separate loops for reading edges and reading node-change data; no accidental nesting.
* Clamp of `S` moved outside all loops.
* `best_time[start]` initialized instead of always `best_time[0]`.
* Dijkstra’s main loop uses a standard “if this state is already worse, continue” check to avoid needing a custom termination condition.
* Clear variable names and no reuse of loop indices.
