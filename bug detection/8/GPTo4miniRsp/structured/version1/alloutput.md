 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here’s a complete review of your script, broken into three parts as requested.

---

### 1. Bugs found

1. **Indentation errors / inconsistent block structure**

   * Many lines are at the wrong level (e.g. the body of the `for i in range(M):` isn’t indented, the `return` in `dijkstra` is inside the `while` but at the wrong depth, etc.).
2. **Shadowing loop variable `i`**

   * You use `for i in range(M):` to read edges, then inside that loop immediately do `for i in range(N):` to read the `Change` array—reusing `i` destroys your outer loop index.
3. **Reading the `Change` array inside the wrong loop**

   * The code that reads the `Change` values is indented under the edge‐reading loop (`for i in range(M): …`), so you read the Change array M times instead of once.
4. **Mis‐placed adjustment of `S`**

   * The line

     ```python
     if S > A_m * N :
         S = A_m * N
     ```

     is indented under the Change‐input loop instead of after both input phases.
5. **Function parameters / scope issues**

   * The function `dijkstra(N, start, Cost, Change)` uses `A_m` and `S` inside, but neither is passed in. While Python will capture the outer‐scope `A_m`, relying on that is fragile and confusing.
6. **Premature `return` in the main loop**

   * Inside `dijkstra`, the `return Ans` is indented so it fires on the first iteration of the `while` loop instead of after it finishes.
7. **Useless / incorrect “early exit” logic with `j` and `Ans`**

   * The code with

     ```python
     j = 1
     for i in range(N):
         if Ans[i] > c:
             j = 0
             break
     if j == 1:
         break
     ```

     is both incorrectly indented and doesn’t do what you probably expect.
8. **Output loop indentation**

   * The final

     ```python
     for i in T[1:]:
         print(i)
     ```

     is mis‐indented relative to everything else.

---

### 2. Causes of each bug (in plain terms)

1. **Indentation/blocks**

   * Python uses indentation to define blocks. When lines aren’t indented consistently, the interpreter can’t tell which statements belong to which loops or functions.
2. **Variable shadowing**

   * Re‐using `i` for two different loops means the inner loop clobbers the outer loop’s counter, so you never actually process all `M` edges correctly.
3. **Mis‐placed Change‐input**

   * Because the Change‐array input is nested under the edge loop, you keep trying to read `N` lines of change‐values for each edge, instead of once. This will either cause an unexpected extra input or run out of input altogether.
4. **`S` adjustment in wrong place**

   * Adjusting `S` before you know the true maximum cost per edge (`A_m`) can produce the wrong cap if you do it too early.
5. **Scope reliance**

   * Relying on outer variables inside a function makes it harder to test, reuse, and reason about the function’s behaviour.
6. **Premature return**

   * Having `return Ans` inside the `while` loop means you give up immediately after the first node‐pop, so you never actually explore the graph.
7. **Broken “all distances settled” check**

   * That `j`‑logic was presumably intended to stop when all nodes have their final shortest distance, but it’s twisted both in indentation and in comparison logic.
8. **Print‐loop mis‐indent**

   * When the output loop sits inside a function or another block by mistake, you either never execute it or do it at the wrong time.

### 3. Suggested corrected code

Below is a cleaned‑up, PEP8–style version. I’ve fixed all of the above bugs, and added comments where each change was made.

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(N, start, initial_fuel, Cost, Change, A_max):
    """
    Finds minimum cost to reach every node, given fuel constraints.
    - N: number of nodes
    - start: starting node index (0-based)
    - initial_fuel: starting amount of fuel
    - Cost[u][v] = [fuel_cost, money_cost]
    - Change[u] = [fuel_gain, money_cost]
    - A_max: maximum fuel cost on any edge
    """
    INF = 10**12
    # Ans[i]: minimum money cost to reach node i
    Ans = [INF] * N
    Ans[start] = 0

    # used[u][f]: minimum money spent to reach state (u, f)
    max_fuel = A_max * N
    used = [[INF] * (max_fuel + 1) for _ in range(N)]
    used[start][initial_fuel] = 0

    # heap entries: (money_spent, fuel_left, node)
    heap = [(0, initial_fuel, start)]

    while heap:
        money_spent, fuel_left, u = heapq.heappop(heap)

        # If we have already found a cheaper way to (u, fuel_left), skip
        if money_spent > used[u][fuel_left]:
            continue

        # Try buying fuel at u
        gain, cost_to_buy = Change[u]
        new_fuel = min(fuel_left + gain, max_fuel)
        if used[u][new_fuel] > money_spent + cost_to_buy:
            used[u][new_fuel] = money_spent + cost_to_buy
            heapq.heappush(heap, (money_spent + cost_to_buy, new_fuel, u))

        # Try traveling to neighbors
        for v in range(N):
            fuel_req, money_cost = Cost[u][v]
            if fuel_req == -1:
                continue  # no edge
            if fuel_left >= fuel_req:
                remaining = fuel_left - fuel_req
                new_money = money_spent + money_cost
                if used[v][remaining] > new_money:
                    used[v][remaining] = new_money
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (new_money, remaining, v))
                    # Update global best for node v
                    if Ans[v] > new_money:
                        Ans[v] = new_money

    return Ans


def main():
    N, M, S = map(int, input().split())

    # Initialize Cost matrix with [-1, -1]
    Cost = [[[-1, -1] for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]
    A_max = 0

    # Read edges
    for _ in range(M):
        u, v, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        u -= 1  # convert to 0-based
        v -= 1
        A_max = max(A_max, a)              # track maximum fuel cost
        Cost[u][v] = [a, b]
        Cost[v][u] = [a, b]

    # Read Change array
    Change = []
    for _ in range(N):
        c, d = map(int, input().split())
        Change.append([c, d])

    # Cap initial fuel S to the maximum reasonable amount
    max_possible = A_max * N
    if S > max_possible:
        S = max_possible

    # Run the modified Dijkstra
    results = dijkstra(N, start=0, initial_fuel=S,
                       Cost=Cost, Change=Change,
                       A_max=A_max)

    # Print results for nodes 2..N
    for cost in results[1:]:
        print(cost)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Key changes & comments

1. **Fixed indentation** throughout, so loops and conditionals are properly nested.
2. **Separated input phases**: edges are read in one loop, then the Change array in its own loop—no shadowing of `i`.
3. **Passed `S` and `A_max` into `dijkstra`** explicitly rather than relying on outer‐scope variables.
4. **Moved the cap on `S`** to after we know `A_max`.
5. **Removed the broken “all settled” check** (`j` logic). Standard Dijkstra termination is when the heap is empty.
6. **Moved `return Ans`** to after the `while` loop, so you only return once exploration is complete.
7. **Converted node indices to 0‑based** immediately after input to simplify all later indexing.
8. **Added docstrings and comments** to explain each part of the logic clearly.

With these fixes, the code should run without syntax or runtime errors, and correctly compute the minimum “money cost” to reach each node under the fuel‐constraint model.
