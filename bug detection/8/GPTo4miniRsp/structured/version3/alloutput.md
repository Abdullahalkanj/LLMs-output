 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Below is a line‐by‐line annotated refactoring. First, I point out the bugs/smells; then I give the corrected, properly indented code with an explanation under each changed line.

---

### Bugs & Suspicious Logic

1. **Indentation**

   * Many blocks (`for`, `if`, `def`, `while`) are mis‐indented, causing loops and the function definition to nest incorrectly.

2. **Nested loops wrong**

   * The loop reading the per‐node `Change` data is inside the `M`‐edge loop and reuses `i`, overwriting it.

3. **`S`‐clamping misplaced**

   * The check `if S > A_m * N:` runs before you’ve read all edges (thus before `A_m` is final).

4. **Weird “j” pruning in Dijkstra**

   * Instead of “if current cost is stale, skip,” there's a convoluted scan over all `Ans` with flags `j`.

5. **Early `return` inside the main `while`**

   * `return Ans` is indented inside the loop, so you bail out on the very first iteration.

6. **Distance array `Ans` initialisation**

   * Always sets `Ans[0]=0` rather than `Ans[start]=0`, so if you ever start somewhere else it’s wrong.

7. **`used` & `Ans` not updated consistently**

   * On “change” transitions we push into the heap without first updating `used[node][newHold]`.

8. **Reusing magic constants**

   * `10**12` scattered; better to name it `INF`.

9. **Printing loop indentation**

   * `print(i)` is not indented under the loop.

### Corrected Code with Explanations

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(N, start, S, A_m, Cost, Change):
    INF = 10**18
    Ans = [INF] * N
    Ans[start] = 0
    maxHold = A_m * N
    # FIX: clamp S here, after A_m is final
    S = min(S, maxHold)
    used = [[INF] * (maxHold + 1) for _ in range(N)]
    used[start][S] = 0
    heap = [(0, start, S)]
    while heap:
        c, node, hold = heapq.heappop(heap)
        # FIX: skip stale states instead of convoluted j-scan
        if c > used[node][hold]:
            continue

        # traverse edges
        for to in range(N):
            a, b = Cost[node][to]
            if a >= 0 and hold >= a:
                newHold = hold - a
                newCost = c + b
                if newCost < used[to][newHold]:
                    used[to][newHold] = newCost
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (newCost, to, newHold))
                    # FIX: update Ans whenever we find a better cost to 'to'
                    if newCost < Ans[to]:
                        Ans[to] = newCost

        # “change” action at current node
        chA, chB = Change[node]
        if hold + chA <= maxHold:
            newHold = hold + chA
            newCost = c + chB
            # FIX: update used before pushing the new state
            if newCost < used[node][newHold]:
                used[node][newHold] = newCost
                heapq.heappush(heap, (newCost, node, newHold))

    return Ans  # FIX: moved return outside the while loop

def main():
    N, M, S = map(int, input().split())
    # FIX: proper initialization of Cost as N×N matrix of [-1,-1]
    Cost = [[[-1, -1] for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]
    Change = [[0, 0] for _ in range(N)]
    A_m = 0

    # read edges
    for _ in range(M):
        u, v, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        u -= 1; v -= 1
        # FIX: keep track of maximum 'a' across all edges
        A_m = max(A_m, a)
        Cost[u][v] = [a, b]
        Cost[v][u] = [a, b]

    # read per-node “change” data
    for i in range(N):
        c, d = map(int, input().split())
        Change[i] = [c, d]

    # run Dijkstra from node 0
    T = dijkstra(N, start=0, S=S, A_m=A_m, Cost=Cost, Change=Change)
    # FIX: properly indent printing under the loop
    for dist in T[1:]:
        print(dist)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Summary of Key Fixes

* **Indentation & block structure** restored so that reading inputs, defining the function, and printing all happen at the correct level.
* **`S` is clamped** after reading *all* edges (so `A_m` is known).
* **Stale‐state skipping** simplified to `if c > used[node][hold]: continue`.
* **Return** moved *outside* the main loop so we exhaust the heap.
* **`Ans` update** moved to whenever a cheaper path to a node is found.
* **`used` update on “change”** added before pushing the new state.
* **Variable reuse** (overwriting `i`) eliminated by using `_` in loops that don’t need the index.
