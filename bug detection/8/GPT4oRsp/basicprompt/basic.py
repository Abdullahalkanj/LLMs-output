# ChatGPT4o output with Basic prompt

# Alright, this code you've shared has quite a messy indentation and some misplaced logic. Let's identify and fix the problems clearly.

# Key Problems:
# Indentation is wrong almost everywhere.

# The input for Change array is wrongly nested inside the edge reading loop.

# The dijkstra function assumes A_m is globally available, but that's not very clean.

# There's a wrong check inside Dijkstra: this part

j = 1
for i in range(N):
    if Ans[i] > c:
        j = 0
        break
if j == 1:
    break

# is unnecessary and wrongly breaks too early.

# Missing an update after buying fuel: you should update the used array.

# Here's the fixed version:

import heapq

N, M, S = map(int, input().split())
Cost = [[[-1, -1] for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]
Change = [[0] * 2 for _ in range(N)]
A_m = 0

for _ in range(M):
    u, v, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    A_m = max(A_m, a)
    Cost[u-1][v-1][0] = a
    Cost[u-1][v-1][1] = b
    Cost[v-1][u-1][0] = a
    Cost[v-1][u-1][1] = b

for i in range(N):
    c, d = map(int, input().split())
    Change[i][0] = c
    Change[i][1] = d

if S > A_m * N:
    S = A_m * N

def dijkstra(N, start, Cost, Change, S, A_m):
    Ans = [10**18] * N
    Ans[start] = 0
    minHeap = []
    used = [[10**18] * (A_m * N + 1) for _ in range(N)]
    used[start][S] = 0
    heapq.heappush(minHeap, (0, S, start))

    while minHeap:
        c, hold, current = heapq.heappop(minHeap)

        if Ans[current] < c:
            continue

        # Try to move to adjacent nodes
        for road in range(N):
            if Cost[current][road][0] != -1:
                if hold >= Cost[current][road][0]:
                    nhold = hold - Cost[current][road][0]
                    nc = c + Cost[current][road][1]
                    if used[road][nhold] > nc:
                        used[road][nhold] = nc
                        heapq.heappush(minHeap, (nc, nhold, road))
                        if Ans[road] > nc:
                            Ans[road] = nc

        # Try to buy fuel at current node
        if hold + Change[current][0] <= A_m * N:
            nhold = hold + Change[current][0]
            nc = c + Change[current][1]
            if used[current][nhold] > nc:
                used[current][nhold] = nc
                heapq.heappush(minHeap, (nc, nhold, current))

    return Ans

T = dijkstra(N, 0, Cost, Change, S, A_m)
for i in T[1:]:
    print(i)


# Main Changes:
# Corrected indentation everywhere.

# Separated reading of roads and fuel change costs properly.

# Removed the early break inside Dijkstra, which was wrong.

# Added proper heap operations (using used updates).

# Fixed the argument passing into dijkstra.

# Summary:
# The core idea is you need a modified Dijkstra's algorithm tracking both cost and fuel amount (hold).
# The code had wrong nested loops, wrong early exits, and bad formatting â€” all fixed here.

# Would you also like me to show a simple example input/output to make sure this works exactly as expected? ðŸš€
# It'll help verify everything visually!
