# Code Analysis: Dijkstra's Algorithm Bug
# I've analyzed the code and found several bugs related to the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding shortest paths with two types of costs.
# Main Issues

# Indentation Issues: The code has inconsistent indentation which affects program flow.
# Early Termination Bug: The most serious bug is in the early termination check which incorrectly exits the main loop.
# Cost Tracking: The used array is updated correctly but not properly leveraged for optimal path finding.

# Detailed Bug Explanation
# The critical bug is in the early termination logic inside the Dijkstra function:

N, M, S = map(int, input().split())
Cost = [[[-1, -1] for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]
Change = [[0] * 2 for _ in range(N)]
A_m = 0

for i in range(M):
    u, v, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    A_m = max(A_m, a)
    Cost[u-1][v-1][0] = a
    Cost[u-1][v-1][1] = b
    Cost[v-1][u-1][0] = a
    Cost[v-1][u-1][1] = b

for i in range(N):
    c, d = map(int, input().split())
    Change[i][0] = c
    Change[i][1] = d

    S = A_m * N

# The indentation here is wrong - the second if j == 1: break statement is indented to be part of the for loop, so it only checks whether to terminate after examining the first vertex. This causes premature termination of the algorithm.
# Additionally, the early termination logic itself is flawed. It's trying to check if we've found the shortest paths to all vertices, but the implementation is incorrect.
# Fixed Version
# Here's the corrected code:
# Fixed Dijkstra's Algorithm ImplementationCodeÂ 
# Key Fixes

# Removed Incorrect Early Termination Logic: The problematic loop with the j variable has been completely removed. Dijkstra's algorithm naturally terminates when the priority queue is empty or when we can no longer find better paths.
# Added Skip Condition: Added a check to skip processing a node if we've already found a better path to it with the same amount of resources.
# Improved Variable Names: Made the code clearer by using more descriptive variable names like new_hold and new_cost.
# Fixed Indentation: Properly indented all code blocks to ensure correct program flow.
# Streamlined Logic: Simplified the nested conditionals for better readability and fewer chances of errors.

# The algorithm now correctly finds the shortest paths from the start node to all other nodes, taking into account both the cost in resources (a) and the cost in time/distance (b), as well as the possibility of charging (gaining resources) at each node.
