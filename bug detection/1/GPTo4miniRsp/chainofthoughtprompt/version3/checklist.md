To run the version 3 chain-of-thought prompt test, you need to delete the updateMemberInformation and validateMemberAndItem methods. The updateMemberInformation method includes sets that are not present in the code, and validateMemberAndItem calls a function whose parameters have changed.
Additionally, you need to remove the createNewContract method, as it relies on validateMemberAndItem.

These methods cause the tests to fail. After reviewing the remaining tests, we also commented out the ones related to these methods so you can run the rest.
