# This code implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure in Python. Let me explain what it does:

# The code defines two classes:

# 1. `Node`: Represents a single node in the tree
#    - Each node contains a key (value)
#    - References to left and right child nodes

# 2. `BST`: The Binary Search Tree class with the following operations:
#    - `insert`: Adds a new node with the given key to the tree
#    - `search`: Finds a node with a specific key
#    - `inorder`: Returns a sorted list of all keys in the tree
#    - `delete`: Removes a node with the specified key

# The BST maintains these key properties:
# - All keys in a node's left subtree are less than the node's key
# - All keys in a node's right subtree are greater than the node's key
# - This ordering makes searching efficient, with O(log n) time complexity in balanced trees

# The main section creates a BST with seven values [50, 30, 20, 40, 70, 60, 80], prints them in sorted order, then demonstrates deletion by removing three nodes (20, 30, 50) one by one, showing the updated tree after each deletion.

# The deletion operation handles three cases:
# 1. Node with no children: Simply remove the node
# 2. Node with one child: Replace the node with its child
# 3. Node with two children: Replace with the smallest value from the right subtree (successor)

# Would you like me to explain any specific part of this code in more detail?

   def search(self, key):
        return self._search_recursive(self.root, key)

    def _search_recursive(self, node, key):
        if node is None or node.key == key:
            return node
        if key < node.key:
            return self._search_recursive(node.left, key)
        else:
            return self._search_recursive(node.right, key)
# mention just: search`: Finds a node with a specific key
