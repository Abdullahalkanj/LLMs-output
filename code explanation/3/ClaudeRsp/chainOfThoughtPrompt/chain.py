# # Purpose of the Code

# This code implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure in Python. A BST is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children (left and right), with the property that all nodes in the left subtree have keys less than the node's key, and all nodes in the right subtree have keys greater than the node's key. This property makes BSTs useful for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

# # Line-by-Line Explanation

# ## Node Class

# ```python
# class Node:
#     def __init__(self, key):
#         self.key = key
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
# ```

# - This class defines a node in the binary search tree
# - Each node has:
#   - `key`: The value stored in the node
#   - `left`: Reference to the left child node (initially None)
#   - `right`: Reference to the right child node (initially None)

# ## BST Class

# ```python
# class BST:
#     def __init__(self):
#         self.root = None
# ```

# - This initializes an empty binary search tree with no root node

# ### Insert Method

# ```python
# def insert(self, key):
#     self.root = self._insert_recursive(self.root, key)
# ```

# - Public method to insert a new key into the BST
# - Calls the private recursive helper method and updates the root

# ```python
# def _insert_recursive(self, node, key):
#     if node is None:
#         return Node(key)
#     if key < node.key:
#         node.left = self._insert_recursive(node.left, key)
#     elif key > node.key:
#         node.right = self._insert_recursive(node.right, key)
#     return node
# ```

# - Private recursive method to insert a key at the correct position
# - If the current node is None, create a new node with the given key
# - If the key is less than the current node's key, insert in the left subtree
# - If the key is greater than the current node's key, insert in the right subtree
# - Returns the modified node (which helps update parent references during recursion)
# - Note that duplicate keys are not inserted (the `elif` means equal keys are ignored)

# ### Search Method

# ```python
# def search(self, key):
#     return self._search_recursive(self.root, key)
# ```

# - Public method to search for a key in the BST
# - Calls the private recursive helper method starting from the root

# ```python
# def _search_recursive(self, node, key):
#     if node is None or node.key == key:
#         return node
#     if key < node.key:
#         return self._search_recursive(node.left, key)
#     else:
#         return self._search_recursive(node.right, key)
# ```

# - Private recursive method to search for a key
# - Returns the node if found, or None if not found
# - If the key is less than the current node's key, search in the left subtree
# - Otherwise, search in the right subtree

# ### Inorder Traversal Methods

# ```python
# def inorder(self):
#     return list(self._inorder_recursive(self.root))
# ```

# - Public method that returns a list of keys in sorted order (inorder traversal)
# - Converts the generator from the recursive helper method to a list

# ```python
# def _inorder_recursive(self, node):
#     if node:
#         yield from self._inorder_recursive(node.left)
#         yield node.key
#         yield from self._inorder_recursive(node.right)
# ```

# - Private recursive generator for inorder traversal
# - Traverses left subtree, then current node, then right subtree
# - Uses `yield from` to delegate to other generators
# - This results in visiting nodes in ascending order of their keys

# ### Delete Method

# ```python
# def delete(self, key):
#     self.root = self._delete_recursive(self.root, key)
# ```

# - Public method to delete a node with the given key
# - Calls the private recursive helper method and updates the root

# ```python
# def _delete_recursive(self, node, key):
#     if node is None:
#         return None
#     if key < node.key:
#         node.left = self._delete_recursive(node.left, key)
#     elif key > node.key:
#         node.right = self._delete_recursive(node.right, key)
#     else:
#         if node.left is None:
#             return node.right
#         elif node.right is None:
#             return node.left
#         succ = self._min_value_node(node.right)
#         node.key = succ.key
#         node.right = self._delete_recursive(node.right, succ.key)
#     return node
# ```

# - Private recursive method to delete a node with the given key
# - If the node is None, return None (key not found)
# - If the key is less than the current node's key, delete from the left subtree
# - If the key is greater than the current node's key, delete from the right subtree
# - If the key matches the current node's key (node to delete found):
#   - If the node has no left child, replace it with its right child
#   - If the node has no right child, replace it with its left child
#   - If the node has both children, find the successor (smallest key in right subtree)
#   - Replace the current node's key with the successor's key
#   - Delete the successor from the right subtree
# - Returns the modified node (helps update parent references during recursion)

# ```python
# def _min_value_node(self, node):
#     current = node
#     while current.left is not None:
#         current = current.left
#     return current
# ```

# - Helper method to find the node with the minimum value in a subtree
# - Repeatedly follows left children until reaching a node with no left child
# - This is used in the delete operation to find the successor node

# ## Main Block

# ```python
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     bst = BST()
#     for key in [50, 30, 20, 40, 70, 60, 80]:
#         bst.insert(key)
#     print("Inorder before deletions:", bst.inorder())
#     for key in (20, 30, 50):
#         bst.delete(key)
#         print("Inorder after deleting", key, ":", bst.inorder())
# ```

# - Creates a new BST instance
# - Inserts keys in this order: 50, 30, 20, 40, 70, 60, 80
# - Prints the keys in sorted order (using inorder traversal)
# - Deletes the keys 20, 30, and 50 one by one
# - After each deletion, prints the new sorted list of keys
# - This demonstrates how the BST maintains its order property even after deletions
