# This code implements a queue data structure using a linked list and demonstrates two different quicksort implementations: one for the linked queue and another for a standard Python list. Let me explain the main components:

# ## LinkedQueue Implementation

# The code defines a `LinkedQueue` class that implements a queue with the following components:

# - An inner `Node` class to represent each element in the linked list
# - Core queue operations: `enqueue`, `dequeue`, and `first`
# - Helper methods like `is_empty` and `__len__`

# The queue follows standard FIFO (First-In-First-Out) behavior where elements are added at the tail and removed from the head.

# ## Quick Sort Implementations

# The code includes two quicksort implementations:

# 1. `quick_sort_queue`: A quicksort algorithm specifically designed for the LinkedQueue structure
#    - It uses three auxiliary queues (L, E, G) to partition elements
#    - L (Less than): elements less than the pivot
#    - E (Equal to): elements equal to the pivot
#    - G (Greater than): elements greater than the pivot
#    - After sorting the L and G queues recursively, it rebuilds the original queue

# 2. `inplace_quick_sort`: A standard in-place quicksort for Python lists
#    - Uses the traditional partition scheme with two pointers
#    - Swaps elements to partition the array around a pivot
#    - Recursively sorts the partitions

# ## Main Execution

# The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block demonstrates both sorting algorithms:

# 1. Creates a `LinkedQueue` with values [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]
# 2. Sorts it using `quick_sort_queue`
# 3. Prints the sorted queue
# 4. Creates a Python list with the same values
# 5. Sorts it using `inplace_quick_sort`
# 6. Prints the sorted list

# The output shows the sorted results from both implementations, which should be [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9].

# Would you like me to explain any specific part of this implementation in more detail?
