# This code implements a doubly linked list data structure and a deque (double-ended queue) that's built on top of it. Let me explain each component:

# ## Base Components

# 1. `Empty` class: A custom exception that's raised when attempting operations on an empty deque.

# 2. `DoublyLinkedBase` class: Provides the core doubly linked list functionality:
#    - Has an inner `Node` class for elements in the list
#    - Uses sentinel nodes (header and trailer) to simplify operations
#    - Tracks the size of the list
#    - Provides methods to insert and delete nodes

# 3. `LinkedDeque` class: Implements a double-ended queue using the doubly linked list structure.

# ## How the Doubly Linked List Works

# The list maintains two special nodes:
# - A `header` node at the beginning (doesn't store an actual element)
# - A `trailer` node at the end (doesn't store an actual element)

# These sentinel nodes simplify edge cases in the code. The actual data is stored in nodes between these two sentinels:

# ```
# header <-> [Node 1] <-> [Node 2] <-> ... <-> [Node n] <-> trailer
# ```

# Each node has references to both its previous and next nodes, allowing efficient traversal in both directions.

# ## The LinkedDeque Implementation

# The `LinkedDeque` class builds on this foundation to provide a double-ended queue with these operations:
# - `first()`: Returns the first element (without removing it)
# - `last()`: Returns the last element (without removing it)
# - `insert_first(e)`: Adds an element to the front
# - `insert_last(e)`: Adds an element to the back
# - `delete_first()`: Removes and returns the first element
# - `delete_last()`: Removes and returns the last element

# ## Example Execution

# The code at the bottom demonstrates usage:
# 1. Creates an empty deque
# 2. Inserts values 1, 2, and 3 at the end of the deque (resulting in [1, 2, 3])
# 3. Prints the first element (1)
# 4. Prints the last element (3)
# 5. Removes and prints the first element (1)
# 6. Removes and prints the last element (3)
# 7. Prints the size (1, as only 2 remains)

# This data structure allows adding and removing elements from both ends in O(1) time, which is more efficient than doing the same operations with a simple array or singly linked list.

# Research Team

# Fail. over all it was general explanation, poor with details.
# especially here:

# def insert_between(self, e, predecessor, successor):
# newest = self.Node(e, predecessor, successor)
# predecessor.next = newest
# successor.prev = newest
# self.size += 1
# return newest

# def delete_node(self, node):
# predecessor = node.prev
# successor = node.next
# predecessor.next = successor
# successor.prev = predecessor
# self.size -= 1
# element = node.element
# node.prev = node.next = node.element = None
# return element

# the explanation just: 
# - Provides methods to insert and delete nodes
