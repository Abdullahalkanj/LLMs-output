# # Doubly Linked List Implementation with Deque Functionality

# This code implements a doubly linked list data structure with deque (double-ended queue) functionality in Python. Let me explain its components and functionality:

# ## Code Structure Overview

# The code consists of three main classes:
# 1. `Empty` - A custom exception class
# 2. `DoublyLinkedBase` - The base class implementing a doubly linked list
# 3. `LinkedDeque` - A class that extends the base list to provide deque operations

# ## Detailed Functionality

# ### `Empty` Exception Class
# This is a simple custom exception raised when operations are attempted on an empty data structure.

# ### `DoublyLinkedBase` Class
# This is the foundation of the implementation, providing core doubly linked list functionality:

# - **Node inner class**: Represents individual nodes in the list with:
#   - `element`: The data stored in the node
#   - `prev`: Reference to the previous node
#   - `next`: Reference to the next node

# - **Initialization**: Creates an empty list with two sentinel nodes:
#   - `header`: A node at the beginning (stores no data)
#   - `trailer`: A node at the end (stores no data)
#   - These sentinels are linked together initially, with the header pointing to the trailer and vice versa
#   - `size`: Tracks the number of actual elements in the list (initially 0)

# - **Core operations**:
#   - `__len__()`: Returns the number of elements in the list
#   - `is_empty()`: Checks if the list contains any elements
#   - `insert_between(e, predecessor, successor)`: Inserts a new element between two existing nodes
#   - `delete_node(node)`: Removes a node from the list and returns its element

# ### `LinkedDeque` Class
# Extends `DoublyLinkedBase` to provide deque functionality (operations at both ends):

# - **Access operations**:
#   - `first()`: Returns (but doesn't remove) the element at the front
#   - `last()`: Returns (but doesn't remove) the element at the back

# - **Insertion operations**:
#   - `insert_first(e)`: Adds an element at the front of the deque
#   - `insert_last(e)`: Adds an element at the back of the deque

# - **Deletion operations**:
#   - `delete_first()`: Removes and returns the first element
#   - `delete_last()`: Removes and returns the last element

# ## Execution Flow

# The `if __name__ == "__main__"` section demonstrates usage:
# 1. Creates a new deque
# 2. Inserts elements 1, 2, 3 at the back (resulting in [1,2,3])
# 3. Prints the first element (1)
# 4. Prints the last element (3)
# 5. Deletes and prints the first element (1)
# 6. Deletes and prints the last element (3)
# 7. Prints the size (1, as only element 2 remains)

# ## Input and Output

# ### Input
# - For insertion operations: The element to be inserted
# - For deletion operations: No input (the operation targets specific positions)

# ### Output
# - `first()` and `last()`: Return the element at the respective end without removing it
# - `delete_first()` and `delete_last()`: Return the removed element
# - `__len__()`: Returns the number of elements in the deque
# - `is_empty()`: Returns a boolean indicating if the deque has no elements

# ### Example Output from the Demo Code
# ```
# first -> 1
# last -> 3
# delete_first -> 1
# delete_last -> 3
# size -> 1
# ```

# ## Key Design Features
# - Use of sentinel nodes (header and trailer) simplifies boundary conditions
# - All operations are implemented with O(1) time complexity
# - The base structure is reusable for other data structures besides deques
# - Memory management is handled by explicitly nullifying references to deleted nodes

# ### Research Team
# Fail. Almost good but miss some details. for example:

# def insert_between(self, e, predecessor, successor):
# newest = self.Node(e, predecessor, successor)
# predecessor.next = newest
# successor.prev = newest
# self.size += 1
# return newest

# def delete_node(self, node):
# predecessor = node.prev
# successor = node.next
# predecessor.next = successor
# successor.prev = predecessor
# self.size -= 1
# element = node.element
# node.prev = node.next = node.element = None
# return element

# the explaination was:
# - `insert_between(e, predecessor, successor)`: Inserts a new element between two existing nodes
# - `delete_node(node)`: Removes a node from the list and returns its element
# So even if the main idea right but did not mention the increment or the decrement with the size, which is importnat
