# # Doubly Linked List and Deque Implementation Explanation

# This code implements a doubly linked list base class and a deque (double-ended queue) data structure using object-oriented programming in Python. Let me explain its purpose and break it down line by line.

# ## Overall Purpose

# This code creates a flexible implementation of a doubly linked list that serves as the foundation for a deque. A deque allows efficient insertion and deletion at both ends of the sequence, which makes it useful for applications that require FIFO (First-In-First-Out) or LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) behavior, or a combination of both.

# ## Line-by-Line Explanation

# ### Empty Exception Class
# ```python
# class Empty(Exception):
#     pass
# ```
# - Defines a custom exception called `Empty` that inherits from Python's built-in `Exception` class
# - Used to handle cases when operations are attempted on an empty deque
# - Contains no additional methods (indicated by `pass`)

# ### DoublyLinkedBase Class
# ```python
# class DoublyLinkedBase:
# ```
# - This is the parent class that implements the core doubly linked list functionality
# - Provides the foundation that the `LinkedDeque` class will extend

# ### Node Inner Class
# ```python
# class Node:
#     def __init__(self, element, prev, next):
#         self.element = element
#         self.prev = prev
#         self.next = next
# ```
# - Defines a nested `Node` class within `DoublyLinkedBase`
# - Each node stores:
#   - `element`: The actual data stored in this node
#   - `prev`: Reference to the previous node in the list
#   - `next`: Reference to the next node in the list

# ### DoublyLinkedBase Constructor
# ```python
# def __init__(self):
#     self.header = self.Node(None, None, None)
#     self.trailer = self.Node(None, None, None)
#     self.header.next = self.trailer
#     self.trailer.prev = self.header
#     self.size = 0
# ```
# - Creates sentinel nodes (`header` and `trailer`) that mark the boundaries of the list
# - The sentinel nodes don't store actual elements (they're `None`)
# - Links the header and trailer to each other to create an empty list
# - Initializes the size counter to 0

# ### Length Method
# ```python
# def __len__(self):
#     return self.size
# ```
# - Returns the number of elements in the list
# - Enables the use of Python's built-in `len()` function on instances of this class

# ### Is_Empty Method
# ```python
# def is_empty(self):
#     return self.size == 0
# ```
# - Checks if the list contains no elements
# - Returns `True` if size is 0, `False` otherwise

# ### Insert_Between Method
# ```python
# def insert_between(self, e, predecessor, successor):
#     newest = self.Node(e, predecessor, successor)
#     predecessor.next = newest
#     successor.prev = newest
#     self.size += 1
#     return newest
# ```
# - Core insertion operation that adds a new node between two existing nodes
# - Creates a new node containing element `e`
# - Updates the links of adjacent nodes to include the new node
# - Increments the size counter
# - Returns the newly created node

# ### Delete_Node Method
# ```python
# def delete_node(self, node):
#     predecessor = node.prev
#     successor = node.next
#     predecessor.next = successor
#     successor.prev = predecessor
#     self.size -= 1
#     element = node.element
#     node.prev = node.next = node.element = None
#     return element
# ```
# - Core deletion operation that removes a node from the list
# - Updates adjacent nodes to bypass the removed node
# - Decrements the size counter
# - Sets node references to `None` to help with garbage collection
# - Returns the element that was stored in the deleted node

# ### LinkedDeque Class
# ```python
# class LinkedDeque(DoublyLinkedBase):
# ```
# - Defines the deque class that inherits from `DoublyLinkedBase`
# - Implements the specific deque operations using the base class functionality

# ### First Method
# ```python
# def first(self):
#     if self.is_empty():
#         raise Empty("Deque is empty")
#     return self.header.next.element
# ```
# - Returns the first element in the deque (without removing it)
# - Throws an `Empty` exception if the deque is empty
# - Accesses the first element by looking at the node after the header

# ### Last Method
# ```python
# def last(self):
#     if self.is_empty():
#         raise Empty("Deque is empty")
#     return self.trailer.prev.element
# ```
# - Returns the last element in the deque (without removing it)
# - Throws an `Empty` exception if the deque is empty
# - Accesses the last element by looking at the node before the trailer

# ### Insert_First Method
# ```python
# def insert_first(self, e):
#     self.insert_between(e, self.header, self.header.next)
# ```
# - Adds a new element at the front of the deque
# - Uses the `insert_between` method from the base class
# - Places it between the header and the current first node

# ### Insert_Last Method
# ```python
# def insert_last(self, e):
#     self.insert_between(e, self.trailer.prev, self.trailer)
# ```
# - Adds a new element at the end of the deque
# - Uses the `insert_between` method from the base class
# - Places it between the current last node and the trailer

# ### Delete_First Method
# ```python
# def delete_first(self):
#     if self.is_empty():
#         raise Empty("Deque is empty")
#     return self.delete_node(self.header.next)
# ```
# - Removes and returns the first element in the deque
# - Throws an `Empty` exception if the deque is empty
# - Uses the `delete_node` method from the base class

# ### Delete_Last Method
# ```python
# def delete_last(self):
#     if self.is_empty():
#         raise Empty("Deque is empty")
#     return self.delete_node(self.trailer.prev)
# ```
# - Removes and returns the last element in the deque
# - Throws an `Empty` exception if the deque is empty
# - Uses the `delete_node` method from the base class

# ### Main Block
# ```python
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     D = LinkedDeque()
#     for i in [1, 2, 3]:
#         D.insert_last(i)
#     print("first ->", D.first())
#     print("last ->", D.last())
#     print("delete_first ->", D.delete_first())
#     print("delete_last ->", D.delete_last())
#     print("size ->", len(D))
# ```
# - This is a demonstration block that runs when the script is executed directly
# - Creates a new deque and adds the elements 1, 2, 3 to it
# - Prints the first and last elements (should be 1 and 3)
# - Removes and prints the first element (1)
# - Removes and prints the last element (3)
# - Prints the final size of the deque (should be 1, as only 2 remains)

# This implementation showcases the power of object-oriented design in creating data structures. The base class provides the fundamental linked list operations, while the derived class adds the specific behaviors needed for a deque.
