# Claude output using basic prompt

# This code implements a queue data structure using a linked list in Python. A queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

# Let me break down the key components:

# 1. The `LinkedQueue` class has an inner `Node` class that represents individual elements in the queue, with each node containing:
#    - `element`: The value stored in the node
#    - `next`: A reference to the next node in the queue

# 2. The `LinkedQueue` main class has:
#    - `head`: Points to the front of the queue (for dequeue operations)
#    - `tail`: Points to the back of the queue (for enqueue operations)
#    - `size`: Tracks the number of elements in the queue

# 3. The key methods are:
#    - `enqueue(e)`: Adds an element to the end of the queue
#    - `dequeue()`: Removes and returns the element at the front of the queue
#    - `is_empty()`: Checks if the queue is empty
#    - `__len__()`: Returns the number of elements in the queue

# 4. The test code at the bottom:
#    - Creates a new queue
#    - Adds the values 10, 20, and 30 to the queue
#    - Removes the first element (10)
#    - Displays the next element in the queue (20)
#    - Shows the current queue size (2)

# When executed, the output would be:
# ```
# enqueue(10)
# enqueue(20)
# enqueue(30)
# dequeue() -> 10
# first remaining -> 20
# current size: 2
# ```

# Would you like me to explain any specific part of this implementation in more detail?

# Fail because didnt give details explanation and did not cover whole the code for example:
# for those methodes Claude just give a definition without explaining the functionality
#    - `enqueue(e)`: Adds an element to the end of the queue
#    - `dequeue()`: Removes and returns the element at the front of the queue
