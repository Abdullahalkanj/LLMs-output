# # LinkedQueue Implementation Analysis

# This code implements a queue data structure using a linked list approach. Let me break down its functionality, inputs, and outputs:

# ## Overall Functionality

# The `LinkedQueue` class is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure where elements are added at the end (tail) and removed from the front (head). This implementation uses linked nodes rather than an array, providing efficient enqueue and dequeue operations that both run in O(1) time.

# ## Class Structure

# 1. **Node (Inner Class)**:
#    - An internal class that represents individual elements in the linked list
#    - Each node stores:
#      - `element`: The actual data value
#      - `next`: A reference to the next node in the queue

# 2. **LinkedQueue (Main Class)**:
#    - Maintains references to:
#      - `head`: The front node of the queue (for dequeue operations)
#      - `tail`: The end node of the queue (for enqueue operations) 
#      - `size`: Current number of elements in the queue

# ## Methods

# ### `__init__(self)`
# - **Functionality**: Initializes an empty queue
# - **Input**: None
# - **Output**: Creates a new LinkedQueue with head and tail set to None, size to 0

# ### `__len__(self)`
# - **Functionality**: Returns the number of elements in the queue
# - **Input**: None
# - **Output**: Integer representing the queue size

# ### `is_empty(self)`
# - **Functionality**: Checks if the queue contains any elements
# - **Input**: None
# - **Output**: Boolean - True if empty, False otherwise

# ### `enqueue(self, e)`
# - **Functionality**: Adds a new element to the end of the queue
# - **Input**: `e` - The element to add
# - **Output**: None, but modifies the queue by:
#   - Creating a new node with the given element
#   - If queue was empty, setting both head and tail to the new node
#   - Otherwise, linking the current tail to the new node and updating tail
#   - Incrementing the size counter

# ### `dequeue(self)`
# - **Functionality**: Removes and returns the element at the front of the queue
# - **Input**: None
# - **Output**: The element at the front of the queue
# - **Error**: Raises an exception if attempting to dequeue from an empty queue
# - **Side Effects**:
#   - Advances the head pointer to the next node
#   - Decrements the size counter
#   - Sets tail to None if the queue becomes empty

# ## Example Execution

# The main block demonstrates basic queue operations:
# 1. Creates an empty queue
# 2. Enqueues 10, 20, and 30 (in that order)
# 3. Dequeues the first element (10)
# 4. Shows the new front element (20)
# 5. Displays the current size (2)

# ## Input/Output Behavior

# - **Input**: Elements of any type can be enqueued
# - **Output**: When dequeuing, elements are returned in the same order they were added (FIFO)

# The code follows good practices by including size tracking, proper empty queue handling, and maintaining both head and tail pointers for efficiency.
